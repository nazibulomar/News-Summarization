            "EastMojoHouston: Scientists in the US have developed a rapid COVID-19 test that can accurately detect all current variants of SARS-CoV-2 within hours.The test, CoVarScan, detects the signatures of eight hotspots on the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWThe researchers at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center in the US tested CoVarScan on samples collected from more than 4,000 patients.The research, published recently in the journal Clinical Chemistry, shows that the test is as accurate as other methods used to diagnose COVID-19, and can successfully differentiate between all current variants of SARS-CoV-2.“Using this test, we can determine very quickly what variants are in the community and if a new variant is emerging, said Jeffrey SoRelle, an assistant professor at UT Southwestern, and senior author of the study.“It also has implications for individual patients when we are dealing with variants that respond differently to treatments,” SoRelle said.While a number of other tests for COVID-19 exist, they generally detect either a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material or small molecules found on the surface of the virus, and don’t provide information to identify the variant.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWIn addition, many researchers worry that these tests are not accurate in detecting some variants, or may miss future strains.To determine which variant of COVID-19 a patient has, scientists typically must use whole genome sequencing, which is time-consuming and expensive, relying on sophisticated equipment and analysis to spell out the entire RNA sequence contained in the viruses.CoVarScan hones in on eight regions of SARS-CoV-2 that commonly differ between viral variants.It detects small mutations — where the sequence of RNA building blocks varies — and measures the length of repetitive genetic regions that tend to grow and shrink as the virus evolves.The method relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — a technique common in most pathology labs — to copy and measure the RNA at these eight sites of interest.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWSoRelle’s team ran the test on over 4,000 COVID-19-positive nasal swab samples collected at UT Southwestern from April 2021 to February 2022 — from patients both with and without symptoms.The tests were validated with the gold-standard whole genome sequencing, and the results were used by doctors to choose treatments in some critically ill COVID-19 patients.Compared to whole genome sequencing, CoVarScan had 96 per cent sensitivity and 99 per cent specificity.It identified and differentiated Delta, Mu, Lambda, and Omicron variants of COVID-19, including the BA.2 version of Omicron, once known as “stealth Omicron because it did not show up on some tests designed to detect only the Omicron strain.“A common critique of this kind of test is that it requires constant adjustment for new variants, but CoVarScan has not needed any adjustment in more than a year; it is still performing very well, said SoRelle.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOW“In the future, if we did need to adjust it, we could easily add as many as 20 or 30 additional hotspots to the test,” he added.SoRelle plans to continue developing CoVarScan as a commercial test and has a pending patent application based on this work.Also read: Watch: Three injured in attack over pet dog in Delhi, video goes viralLatest StoriesPlay real money online casino games at Pure Win, where everyone can win real rupee cash prizes!

            "Grievance RedressalMANILA, Philippines — An adviser to the pandemic task force recommended that the government keeps Alert Level 1 across most of the country even as COVID-19 cases rise, saying that this is not a cause for alarm while the number of severe cases and hospital utilization rates remain low.Dr. Edsel Salvaña, who is an infectious diseases expert, said vaccines against the coronavirus have kept severe COVID-19 cases low, protecting the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.“Because of vaccines, because of boosting, severe cases remain low,” Salvaña said partly in Filipino over state-run People’s Television on Tuesday. “Even if cases increase to 2,000 or 5,000, we don’t expect it to overwhelm the healthcare system and we do not need to lock down.”Most of the country, including Metro Manila will remain under Alert Level 1 until July 15.From June 27 to July 3, COVID-19 cases in the Philippines rose by 60% to 7,398 additional cases from 4,634 cases logged from June 20 to 26, according to the Department of Health.But of the total cases 497 or only 8.4% of total COVID-19 patients have severe and critical disease, while 15.3% of 2,487 beds in intensive care units are in use and only 19.9% of non-ICU beds are in use.“Don’t panic. Nothing good ever comes out of panicking,” Salvaña said.He said people should continue using masks and get boosted against the coronavirus if they have not done so already.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. still has not appointed a health chief amid the ongoing pandemic, but the DOH said Monday that its senior career officials are leading its COVID-19 response and other operations in the meantime. — Xave GregorioPhilstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.

            "                    In a recent article posted to the medRxiv* preprint server, researchers in the United States analyzed the pneumococcal carriage in older adults in the Greater New Haven Area, United States (US), during the implementation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation strategies.Study: Persistence of pneumococcal carriage among older adults in the community despite COVID-19 mitigation measures. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / ShutterstockThe COVID-19 mitigation strategies significantly impacted other infectious disease incidences. Major respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza, largely vanished as disease-causing agents in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter of 2020–21. All age categories experienced a substantial fall in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the 2020 spring. It did not reach almost normal levels again until the 2021 spring/summer.There was a significant rate of pneumococcus transmission across children in the initial year of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Yet, social distancing and other COVID-19 mitigation approaches might have decreased the frequency of interaction and pneumococcal transmission from children to adults.The rapid decline in adult pneumococcal illness after vaccinating children with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines made it clear that children represent a significant source of pneumococcus exposure for adults. Nevertheless, the prevalence of pneumococcus across older adults during this time is uncertain.In the present study, the researchers at Yale University and Pfizer Inc hypothesized that some of the decreases in IPD seen in adult populations may have resulted from diminished contact between adults and children during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, the team assessed the pneumococcal carriage rates of persons aged 60 years or older who were enrolled in an active longitudinal pneumococcal carriage research and lived in the community in the US in the years 2020–21. Study objectives included measuring and identifying pneumococcal carriage rates among older adults and assessing household transmission among cohabiting older adults.From October 2020 to August 2021, the authors recruited couples residing in the Greater New Haven Area who were both 60 years or older and without residents under 60 years in their households. The participation of the household pair in the study was postponed by around four weeks if they had signs of a respiratory infection at the time of registering, received a pneumococcal vaccination, or had recently taken antibiotics during the previous four weeks. No subjects were excluded from the investigation based on comorbidity status.For 10 weeks, questionnaires about social activities, interactions, and health history were collected every two weeks, along with saliva samples. Additionally, all spit samples were checked for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) utilizing the extraction-free Saliva Direct test. After culture enrichment, collected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was examined for the pneumococcus-specific sequences: lytA, and piaB, employing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Study volunteers were regarded positive for pneumococcal carriage when cycle threshold (Ct)-values for piaB were <40.The authors noted that in the current research, older individuals living in the community remained pneumococcus-positive at rates comparable with other pre-pandemic experiments of elderly persons that used similar molecular techniques. This was contrary to the significant drop in reported IPD rates among adults in the first winter season of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., 2020–21. Moreover, the team mentioned that the current investigation was performed when SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related transmission mitigation techniques were in effect.The study results indicated that the scientists procured 567 saliva samples from 95 adults aged 60 years or older from one singleton and 47 household pairs. Among these samples, 7.1% were pneumococcus-positive containing either just piaB (six samples) or both lytA and piaB (34 samples), comprising 22/95, or 23.2%, of the individuals and 16/48, or 33.3%, of the households during the 10-week long trial. Study volunteers attended a few social gatherings during this time. Many participants, nevertheless, still had frequent interactions with children. People who regularly interacted with two to 9-year-olds, i.e., preschool and school-aged children, had a greater rate of pneumococcus carriage, i.e., 15.9% versus 5.4%.According to the study findings, the Greater New Haven Area's older adults often had pneumococcus infections in the 10-week study period, despite SARS-CoV-2-linked disruptions. Those who interacted with school-aged children notably had a higher prevalence, but this group was not the only ones affected.The researchers discovered little indication of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts on rates of pneumococcal carriage in older individuals in the first research period of an ongoing investigation examining rates of pneumococcal carriage in Greater New Haven. The study findings imply that school-aged children were the most likely source of the pneumococcus that persisted in most study participants during the time of decreased social contact.The high frequency of the non-specific signal found in the commonly used lytA qPCR test highlights the significance of focusing on several gene targets for accurate and precise pneumococcus detection in oral samples. Additional research using molecular serotyping of the procured samples will shed more light on this observation and the pneumococcal transmission patterns in households with only people over 60 years.medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.Posted in: Men's Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women's Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Children, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, covid-19, CT, DNA, Frequency, Gene, Influenza, Pandemic, Pneumococcal Disease, Polymerase, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Research, Respiratory, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Syndrome, VirusWritten byShanet Susan Alex, a medical writer, based in Kerala, India, is a Doctor of Pharmacy graduate from Kerala University of Health Sciences.

So what, if anything, is being done to slow the death toll?\"If you've had two or one, and you haven't had your full three, putting it bluntly – you're crazy,\" Mr Hazzard said.\"That is what is going to make a difference to stopping or reducing the chances of you ending up in hospital or ending up possibly dying.\"Dr Chant said two doses were appropriate for the Delta variant but were no longer enough to protect against severe disease from Omicron variants. \"Disregard anything we said about two doses. It's three doses or more,\" she said.\"And as ATAGI continues to watch the evidence they might broaden the criteria ... for further vaccines.\"Mr Hazzard said he did not want to see any new mandates or rules imposed to combat the next wave.\"We saw the results in some states, not so much in NSW but in other states, where people saw the requirements imposed on them were challenging,\" he said.\"I think most people are pretty sensible.\"Fourteen people with COVID have died in NSW in the last 24 hours and 58 people with the virus are currently in intensive care units, 18 more people than a week ago.In NSW, 1,782 people with COVID are in hospital, although that number includes people who were hospitalised for other reasons.While more than 95 per cent of the state's eligible population has received two doses of a COVID vaccine, just 68 per cent are considered 'up to date' with their third dose.A fourth dose is currently available for people who are immunocompromised or with a significant medical condition, people over 65 and those in aged care homes, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over 50 years old.Many epidemiologists say current scientific evidence shows while a fourth dose is helpful in some demographics to prevent severe disease, it doesn't do much to prevent disease in younger, healthy people.See our full coverage of coronavirusWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)Another wave of Covid-19 could be on its way with a new Omicron subvariant seeing case numbers back on the rise. Video / NZ Herald / Ben CumminsMultimedia JournalistA Covid expert says he is not ruling out New Zealand going back into red within the next few weeks as Covid numbers continue to rise.There are 9629 new community cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand today - up by more than 3000 from yesterday.The regions with the most new cases in the past 24 hours are Canterbury, with 1549 cases, and Waitematā, with 1266.Auckland recorded 924 cases, Capital and Coast had 827, Southern 809 and Counties Manukau 731 new infections.The worst-affected region remains Auckland, with 15,983 people infected with Covid.University of Auckland senior lecturer in computational evolution Dr David Welch has been mapping the emergence of the BA.5 Omicron subvariant and its contribution to the rise in Covid numbers.\"Going back to red is something that the Government would be looking at very closely right now, they'd be looking at how the hospitals are coping and what are the projections,\" Welch said.\"Our hospitals are already really, really full. Not only because of Covid but also because of other winter illnesses. We expect these cases to continue to rise and there'll be just more pressure on the health system.\"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the rise in case numbers was \"no expectation\" of moving to red.Last week, Covid-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said: \"When we moved out of red in April the rolling average of cases was nearly 10,000 a day and there were over 500 people in hospital including 28 in ICU\".The Ministry of Health today also reported a further 24 Covid-related deaths. Of the 24 deaths, three people were in their 40s, five were in their 70s, seven in their 80s, and nine were aged over 90.There are 493 people in hospital with the virus, including 11 in intensive care.And the Omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has been detected in New Zealand for the first time.Welch said it was the BA.5 Omicron subvariant that \"we should be worried about\".It is appearing as more transmissible and will overtake BA.2 to be the dominant variant in a matter of weeks, he said.\"It's now gotten close to the point where BA.5 is becoming the dominant variant, and so that's why we are seeing the case numbers going up,\" he said.\"The BA.2.75 is yet another variant, and one that we're watching closely and it's just kind of come to the attention of people around the world. In terms of what's happening here, it won't be having an impact on case numbers right now.\"The ministry says at this stage, there is no evidence BA.2.75 requires a shift in the public health settings already in place to manage other Omicron variants.On Friday afternoon, analysis of whole genome sequencing confirmed two cases in New Zealand with BA.2.75. Before testing positive for Covid-19, both had recently travelled from India.BA.2.75 is a recently identified second-generation subvariant of BA.2, the dominant variant circulating in New Zealand at this stage. BA.2.75 has only been recently identified as distinct from BA.2, and evidence on its transmissibility, immune evasiveness and severity is still preliminary and emerging.\"I certainly won't rule out going back into red within the next few weeks, but then again I'm not sure if it is politically feasible and whether people will listen this time,\" Welch said.\"But there are a lot of things that people can do without having to wait for the Government to make it mandatory, like mask-wearing at schools, for example. Anecdotally, schools that have made masking mandatory have not had the illnesses that other schools have.\"Red is the most restrictive traffic light setting, where face coverings are mandatory when travelling on public transport, in retail and to an extent in education. Public facilities and retail outlets are open, with capacity limits.Welch said everyone who is eligible for boosters should be taking them - especially those who can now get the fourth vaccination jab.\"People need to reset and recalibrate their risk level. We have been so used to going out and about a bit more, and that was fine when case numbers were lower and decreasing,\" Welch said.\"Now we're in a situation where they are higher and increasing and people should reconsider when they should be getting into that crowded environment, and when they should be wearing that mask or not.\"\r\n",

            "                    In a recent study published in The Lancet, researchers in the United Kingdom determined whether an individual with a higher body mass index (BMI) mounted a weaker immune response to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Additionally, they investigated vaccine uptake and the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in such individuals.Study: Associations of BMI with COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England: a population-based cohort study. Image Credit: GrooTrai / ShutterstockBy 2021, around 82.5% of the United Kingdom (UK) population had received a two-dose regimen of COVID-19 vaccines. However, there is no information about the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for the nine million UK population stratified by BMI groups.Studies have shown that the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is lower among individuals with a higher BMI. Since COVID-19 is also a respiratory infection; therefore, it warrants investigation of whether there is an association between BMI and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE). In addition, the long-term evidence across a range of COVID-19 outcomes in all BMI groups is also needed because it might reveal the need for alternative risk mitigation strategies and targeted vaccine booster programs for people at high risk.In the present observational cohort study, researchers used the QResearch database of general practice records to identify individuals for whom the BMI data was available and who were vaccinated between December 8, 2020, and November 17, 2021, in England. They calculated vaccine uptake as the fraction of individuals with zero, one, two, or three vaccine doses across four BMI categories. The BMI categories were - underweight (<18.5kg/m2), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9kg/ m2), overweight (25 to 29kg/ m2) , and obese (>30kg/ m2). The study analysis accounted for several demographic confounders, including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and relevant comorbidities.The team also investigated VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Further, using a matched case-control design, they estimated the odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 outcomes in vaccinated individuals vis-à-vis those who had not, considering vaccine dosage and time elapsed since vaccination. Lastly, they estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes associated with BMI following vaccination using multivariable cox proportional hazard models.Of 9,171,524 participants, 5,666,461 were COVID-19 positive during the study duration. Eventually, 32,808 COVID-19 positive participants were hospitalized, and 14,389 died. Of all the study participants, 19.2% were unvaccinated. Of the remaining participants, 3.1%, 52.6%, and 25% received one, two, and three vaccine dose(s), respectively. The average age of the study participants was 52 years, and the average BMI was 26.7 kg/m².Proportion of people who received no, one, two, or three vaccination doses by age and BMI groupThe vaccine uptake was lower in underweight people compared to overweight or obese people (70 to 83% vs. over 80%). These individuals were 40 years or older and had received two or three vaccine doses. Across all four BMI groups, the study results were significantly heterogeneous concerning protection against severe COVID-19.Accordingly, hospitalization ORs for underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.51, 0.34, 0.32, and 0.32, respectively. Likewise, ORs of COVID-19-related death for under-weight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.60, 0.39, 0.30, and 0.26, respectively. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, hospitalization and death were higher after 14 days of the second vaccine dose in vaccinated individuals. Also, in the vaccinated participants, the correlation between BMI and COVID-19 hospitalization and death was linear after the first and J-shaped after the second vaccine dose. The researchers observed an inverse U-shaped association between BMI and the third vaccine dose, indicating that a booster was needed to confer complete protection in obese people.Furthermore, the first and second sets of sensitivity analyses used two different cohorts. The first set had individuals for whom the BMI records for two years before cohort enrollment were available. Their VE showed smaller ORs compared with the primary study analysis; however, the results of both sensitivity analyses were generally in agreement with the main study findings.Risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 after vaccination Estimates of risk after 14 days from each vaccine dose. Adjusted for age, calendar week, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, smoking status, hypertension, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and care home status. Hospital admissions from COVID-19 after first dose (A), second dose (B), and third dose (C), and deaths from COVID-19 after first dose (D), second dose (E), and third dose (F).The current large population-based cohort study evidenced that COVID-19 vaccines confer protection against severe disease; however, of similar magnitude in obese as well as normal-weight people. However, the VE had reduced for underweight individuals among those with lower vaccine uptake across all ages. Moreover, the study findings pointed to a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 in obese and underweight people in the vaccinated cohort because they had lower vaccine uptake and showed much reduced VE. Overall, these results highlighted the need for concerted efforts to increase vaccine uptake in people with BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2. Indeed, creating awareness among people to maintain a healthy weight could help lessen the COVID-19 burden.Posted in: Child Health News | Men's Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women's Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Body Mass Index, Cardiovascular Disease, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, Diabetes, Hospital, Immune Response, Influenza, Respiratory, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Smoking, Syndrome, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, VaccineWritten byNeha is a digital marketing professional based in Gurugram, India.

Health Minister Adrian Dix is considering making COVID-19 shots widely available in the fall, as experts predict a third Omicron wave is on the way.The provincial health-care system is getting ready for a fall wave and looking at a federal advisory body's recommendations that booster doses be made widely available, Dix said speaking at a news conference Monday.Meanwhile, the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group, made up of interdisciplinary experts who work independently from the government, warns that a wave of COVID-19 driven by the more infectious and immune-evasive BA.5 sub-variant of Omicron is emerging.Dix said everyone should plan to get another vaccine dose in the fall. \"We have to protect the ones we love and to protect ourselves in a pandemic that is still with us, still affecting us.\"Dix did not provide any further information about whether the doses would be targeted toward BA.5 specifically, or how they would be rolled out.It comes as the province is preparing to dispose of more than 200,000 vaccine doses amid a slow uptake of third and fourth shots.Public Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said two weeks ago that those hoping for a fourth dose would still have to wait until they are eligible. They are currently only available for people aged 70 and older, Indigenous people over 55, and people in long-term care — six months after their last booster.Dix also said the province wouldn't rule out bringing back masks in indoor spaces come the fall and encouraged people to get vaccinated.About 1.4 million people who are eligible for a third dose have not taken it, Dix said, adding that vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19.Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, said people should take precautions — especially to avoid getting long COVID.\"I don't want to hear on the street, as I hear often: 'Thank God it's over.' It's not over. It may never be fully over,\" he said. \"Most experts are suggesting that there will be a significant increase in transmission in the fall.\"COVID-19 is having a significant effect on the province's health-care workers, Dix said. Numerous emergency rooms and acute care units have been closed in B.C. over the past few weeks due to staff shortages.\"There were 16,400 people who missed at least one day due to illness last week in our public health-care system,\" he said. \"That's on a base of about 160,000 workers … so about 10.2 per cent.\"Normally it would be about six per cent, he said, adding that COVID-19 is contributing to the rising numbers.Asked what the province is doing to avert the closures, Dix pointed to new hiring initiatives.\"We're going to continue to do that work in communities to make sure that people are safe, our workers are safe, and most importantly, patients are safe,\" said Dix, who was speaking at a press conference announcing a new hospital in Surrey, about 34 km southeast of Vancouver, which is expected to begin construction next summer.With files from Jessica CheungAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

            "\tOttawa Public Health says Ottawa is entering a new wave of COVID-19.\r\n",
            "\tIn a statement to CTV News Ottawa on Monday, deputy medical officer of health Dr. Brent Moloughney said OPH is monitoring rising levels of the virus in the community.\r\n",
            "\t\"As we enter a new wave, it’s important to consider your risk, and the risk of those around you when gathering. Ottawa Public Health continues to highly recommend people keep practicing the measures that we know work – being up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations, limiting close contacts, staying home if you’re not feeling well, avoiding crowded areas, and wearing a mask,\" he said.\r\n",
            "\tOPH's COVID-19 dashboard only updates on Tuesdays and Fridays and there was no update on Canada Day. As of last Tuesday's report, OPH was reporting an increase in the number of confirmed cases reported per day and an increase in the positivity rate of people who are still being tested.\r\n",
            "\tThe number of new cases reported the week of June 19 was 423, slightly higher than the peak of the Sept. 2021 wave, but still well below the all-time high of 7,000 cases reported the week of Dec. 26, 2021. Testing eligibility was looser in 2021 than it is now and laboratory-confirmed case counts in 2022 are generally considered an underrepresentation of the amount of COVID-19 in the community.\r\n",
            "\tThe Ottawa COVID-19 wastewater monitoring project’s latest data show the seven-day mean viral signal detected in the city’s sewage as of last week was almost as high as it was at the peak of the January 2022 wave, but it remains below the April 2022 wave that saw the viral signal hit an unprecedented high.\r\n",
            "\tThe number of COVID-19 hospitalizations remained low as of last week’s report from OPH. As of June 28, OPH has recorded 74,866 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 819 residents of Ottawa have died from the disease.\r\n",
            "\tAt least 209 residents of Ottawa have died of COVID-19 so far in 2022, compared to 228 in all of 2021 and 381 between March and December 2020.\r\n",
            "\tMoloughney’s comment comes amid discussion around expanding COVID-19 vaccine booster dose eligibility to allow residents 18 and older to receive a fourth dose. Currently, fourth doses are not available to any under the age of 60 in Ontario.\r\n",
            "\tCanada’s Chief Medical Officer and the National Advisory Council on Immunization (NACI) are telling provinces to launch booster dose campaigns in the fall, but some experts are calling for boosters to be made more widely available now.\r\n",
            "\tOttawa epidemiologist Dr. Raywat Deonandan told Newstalk 580 CFRA on Sunday that the fall is too late to start boosters with a wave on the way, and Ottawa physician Dr. Nili Kaplan-Myrth has said she’d bring legal action against the provincial government if booster eligibility remains restricted much longer.\r\n",
            "\t“Waiting until the fall, when we’re told that it’s going to be really bad in the fall, is ridiculous; we should be able to access the vaccine now,” Kaplan-Myrth says. \r\n",
            "\t“A lot of people were going across to Quebec to get the vaccine because anyone 18 and over there get it but, unfortunately, many places in Quebec are now turning away Ontario residents, and so now people are having to drive to the United States.”\r\n",
            "\tMoloughney said the decision to expand booster eligibility is in the hands of the provincial health ministry.\r\n",
            "\tIn a statement, the Ministry of Health said fourth doses are available for populations at greater risk, but a review of the guidelines is underway.\r\n",
            "\t\"We are reviewing NACI’s most recent guidance and will be providing details for fall booster shots over the coming weeks,\" the statement said.\r\n",
            "\tTo date, 64 per cent of residents of Ottawa 12 and older have had a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from OPH.\n",

            " All rights reserved. Use of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy PolicyIf you've noticed your kids are getting sick more often lately, you're likely not the only one. P.E.I.'s College of Family Physicians says doctors have been seeing a high number of children with non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses recently.Dr. Heather Austin, president of the college, said there are a number of factors that could be contributing to the increase, including the fact that throughout the pandemic children have had little exposure to these respiratory viruses. \"We are seeing a lot of upper respiratory illnesses within our population at this point in time,\" she said.She said the lifting of mandates and public health restrictions also plays a role.\"Mostly it is moving away from the mandatory masking regulations and having us be in close proximity and able to spread all of the different viruses and pathogens that are in our environment to each other again.\" Austin said many older people have built up an immunity to many of these viruses, but when it comes to children some are likely being exposed to certain viruses for the first, second or third time. \"They don't have that same built-up immunity so they're more likely to develop an infection from an exposure,\" she said. Austin also said it may seem like children are catching colds or illnesses that simply won't go away. But it's more likely that the child is actually being infected with a number of different viruses, one after the other. According to the province's latest flu data, there have been 50 lab-confirmed cases of the flu for the 2021-2022 season. The median age of those cases is about 12 years old. The spike in respiratory illnesses is something emergency room physician, Dr. Trevor Jain has noticed as well. \"For the last six weeks we've seen an uptick in respiratory illnesses in the pediatric population and that mostly has to do with mandates changing,\" Jain said. He said it is unusual to see increased respiratory illness at this time of year. Typically infections of flu and other viruses spike fall, winter or early spring among children, Jain said. \"We're talking anything from the common cold to RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], to croup, increased asthma due to viral infections, even some pneumonia,\" he said.\"That was a little unexpected but when you think about it, you know we have increased mixing of the population, dropping of mandates so it just goes to show that those public health measures pre-vaccination were very effective at limiting the spread of respiratory illnesses.\" Jain said the emergency room is now starting to see the number of admissions for respiratory illnesses go down. Dr. Austin said typically a virus could involve mild symptoms over three to five days, like a low-grade fever, congestion, cough, sore throat and a runny nose. Coughing can sometimes last for up to three weeks in some cases and just as the child is recovering, they pick up another virus. \"The times when you'd want to seek medical attention would be a persistent fever, certainly a fever beyond five days,\" Austin said. \"If they're very lethargic, sleepy, not themselves, not eating and drinking in the usual way.\"She said if a child is in pain or struggling to breath they should also get medical attention.To limit the spread of respiratory illness, Austin said people should make sure they are washing their hands regularly and to stay home if they feel unwell.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Wachter, Chair of UCSF Department of Medicine, stands for a portrait on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020 in San Francisco, Calif.The new BA.5 strain of the COVID-causing virus is “a different beast” from ones we’ve already seen — more infectious and better able to evade immune responses — and “we need to change our thinking” about how to defend against it, according to a data-packed Twitter thread posted today by Dr. Bob Wachter, UCSF’s chair of medicine.BA.5, a sub-variant of the Omicron family which has an altered version of the virus’s infamous “spike” protein, will soon become the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S., meaning that “its behavior will determine our fate for the next few months, until it either burns itself out by infecting so many people or is replaced by a variant that’s even better at infecting people,” Wachter wrote.“Neither is a joyful scenario,” he added.The number of new COVID cases per day has plateaued nationally and is down significantly since January. The same is true for the number of COVID hospitalizations in the UCSF health system, Watchter said. However, the true spread of COVID is harder to know these days, because so many people are testing themselves with at-home kits.And BA.5 could cause a continued plateau, or even a new surge of infections and possibly hospitalizations, because it infects more easily and also is better at evading immune responses — even in vaccinated people, Wachter wrote.While he stressed that vaccines and vaccine booster shots “remain hugely valuable in preventing a severe case” that might lead to hospitalization or death, the increased slippieriness of BA.5 means that existing vaccines will probably be less effective at preventing mild COVID cases or stopping transmission in the first place. Also, he wrote, prior infection by a different variant “no longer provides robust protection from reinfection” with BA.5.What should a person do, then?COVID-19 Map: Data on trends in the Bay Area and across CaliforniaLatest news: Complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemicWachter said it depends on how badly you want to avoid getting COVID. Personally, he said, he doesn’t want to risk getting “Long COVID” and the debilitating symptoms that come with it, “So I still avoid indoor dining & will continue to wear an N95 in crowded indoor spaces until cases come way down.” Others might make different choices.As for governments, he said, if BA.5 causes a surge in hospitalizations, “particularly if we also have staff shortages,” a return to mask mandates “would be the right call.” But Wachter acknowledged there would likely be fierce resistance to new mask-wearing requirements, especially outside of blue states, regardless of the danger.“Most people have ditched their masks,” he wrote.Jason Fagone (he/him) is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

            " Gordon Deegan Up to 40 people were present in a marquee for a late night \"prisoner release party\" going at \"full throttle\" during a strict Covid-19 lockdown, a court has heard.Sgt Claire Heneghan told Ennis District Court she saw flashing disco lights and heard very loud music when she first called to the address at St Enda’s, Beechpark, on the outskirts of Ennis, Co Clare on February 8th, 2021. She said most of the 30 to 40 people at the event appeared to be drinking alcohol.Sgt Heneghan said on the night she was approached by Rose Joyce (53), who said she was staging the event \"for a son who was released from prison earlier that day\".In court, Ms Joyce – who lives at the address – denied saying this and also denied staging an organised event in breach of Covid-19 health regulations when such gatherings were banned.The country was in a Covid lockdown at the time and Judge Alec Gabbett convicted Ms Joyce of staging the event in contravention of Covid-19 regulations and fined her €200.Judge Gabbett said Sgt Heneghan “had been more than fair to Ms Joyce on the night”.The judge said: “When Sgt Heneghan called at 10.37pm the party was at half throttle and Sgt Heneghan had asked Ms Joyce to turn the music down but when she returned at 11.37pm the party was at full throttle”.Judge Gabbett said when Sgt Heneghan called at 11.37pm “the party was still going hard and heavy”.Sgt Heneghan said when she called at 11.37pm, the disco lights were still flashing and the music was still very loud. She said she returned after gardaí received numerous complaints about loud music at the address.She said she directed that the party cease and people were to leave.Sgt Heneghan said she was satisfied that an illegal organised event was taking place in breach of Covid-19 regulations.The Garda Sargeant told the court that Ms Joyce – represented by solicitor, Tara Godfrey – told her that she would have the music turned down but said she wasn’t doing anything wrong as it was all the one family.However, Sgt Heneghan said despite the request that the party cease, the party continued for a number of hours until the early hours.Sgt Heneghan told the court that she issued a Fixed Charge Penalty Notice to Ms Joyce the following day and it remains unpaid resulting in the issuing of the court summons.Want us to email you top stories each lunch time?

            "Photo / SuppliedNorthern Advocate Multimedia JournalistNorthland health providers are begging the public to get the flu vaccine to prevent serious illness as the health system fights a twindemic of flu and Covid 19.The calls come as reports emerge that Whangārei Hospital has been treating patients in tents and corridors as virus infections surge.Bush Rd Medical Centre GP Dr Geoff Cunningham said the twindemic along with Northland's long-running GP shortage has doctors struggling to keep up.\"It's having a massive impact, we're just frantically busy.\"The problem is that we can't be sure what's Covid and what's flu.\"The symptoms of both viruses overlap, but you often can't tell from your symptoms which virus you have.\"We're seeing a lot of very sick people with influenza.\"We couldn't be busier and the normal general practice work doesn't stop.\"Cunningham also works at White Cross after-hours medical centre, which is facing similar issues.\"We've got staff shortages at White Cross necessitating early closes, unfortunately.\"Primary care is the cornerstone of the healthcare system and if that falls over, we can all see what's happening.\"Epidemiologist Michael Baker has called for mandatory 7-day isolation for those who contract the flu, treating the illness the same way we deal with Covid-19.\"That's probably not unreasonable,\" Cunningham said of Baker's flu isolation idea.\"The severity of influenza that we're seeing in patients is reasonably similar to what we're seeing in the Omicron variant of Covid.\"Cunningham said the flu jab is the best way to avoid becoming severely ill if you catch the flu, or even catching it all together,\"The flu jab is always your best protection against influenza.\"It's strongly recommended, we consider it essential.\"\"If people aren't overly unwell, they can just do sensible self-care, that's staying at home, paracetamol, fluids.\"Of course, if they're really concerned and they're getting increasingly unwell we need to and want to see them.\"Far North health provider Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa spokesman Raniera Kaio said the increase in demand for support was being felt by the team's nurses.\"There's been an uptake in the number of calls and appointments through our health service, just in regard to the fact that they can't get an appointment with the doctors... because there is so much flu around as well as Covid.\"The nurses are managing at the moment, but they definitely can see that this will not last long term, it will be a clear drain on our resources both human and otherwise.\"The Māori health organization in Kāeo is waiting with crossed fingers for increased support under the new Health NZ oversight as promised in the Government's 2022 Budget.\"A small health provider service like ours runs on a team of five, one of them goes down (with illness) it's sort of dominoes from there.\"It's not all bad news for the Far North. Kaio said the team had a successful response to community immunisation.\"Last month we had a bit of an immunization drive... leading into winter and autumn.\"(We) delivered, I think twice as many flu vaccines as we did last year.\"The health provider has also seen success with its mobile health service, delivering the flu vaccine to the rural Far North community.\"They've seen those numbers and requests for the flu vaccine out as far north as Hihi.\"\"The public definitely recognized that this was going to be a problem this year.\"Anyone over six months can have a flu vaccine according to the Ministry of Health.Do you have cold or flu symptoms? If so:The best treatment is to stay home and get plenty of rest, fluids and medicines that ease your symptoms.You don't need antibiotics (they won't fix your cold, flu or Covid-19).To check for Covid, take a RAT test and isolate if needed.For 24/7 health advice and guidance for when to seek medical care, freephone Healthline on 0800 611 116 or download and check the Emergency Q app.Nigerian Folklore Musician, Jimi SolankeVeteran entertainer, Jimi Solanke, clocks 80 years today!The iconic artist, who made a name for himself as a versatile dramatist, musician and folklorist in a career spanning the 50s to the present, spoke ahead of his birthday, which has set the Nigerian arts circuit agog with celebration, after a spectacular performance at a gathering of culture enthusiasts, literary and creative artists recently in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.The soiree, held at Tunde Odunlde Arts Connexions Gallery in the elitist Bodija district, was reminiscent of the Ibadan arts circuit in the 60s which was the hub of cultural activities and artistic talents featuring, among others, the likes of Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, Christopher Okigbo, John Pepper Clarke-Bekederemo, Demas Nwoko, Duro Ladipo, Yomi Ogunmola and their works.In the interview, Mr Solanke spoke on trends in the global music scene vis- a -vis Nigerian youths’ seeming alienation from indigenous music and their cultural roots, effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the entertainment industry, as well an update on a creative and performing arts enhancement centre he is developing in Ipara, his home town in Ogun State.Described by CNN as a ‘Master story teller’, the artist has harsh words for the nation’s rulers and political class whom he accuses of ‘killing’ the creative industry like other sectors with their indifference, corruption, lack of vision and innovative policies that could help in developing it.Uncle Jimi, as he is fondly called, also shares the secrets of his agility and vibrancy even at fourscore.EXCERPTS:Exactly what do you mean by your remark on stage a while ago that the Ibadan you met on this visit was different from the one you used to know?Jimi Solanke: Since the 60s, Ibadan has been a very culturally, artistically-oriented city. Where the Lekan Salami Stadium is now was a location where we (artists) all ended up in the evenings, coming from all over the town to enjoy ourselves. When you are tired of that place, you can walk down and get to Keru’s hotel. Baba Keru on Ife road. Reverse, and you are at Ekotedo Iya Olobe, there is a bubbling spot there. Reverse again and you would touch West end where Mbari Club from which all of us grew up to know what the depth of cultural involvement is.Go up, you will see the Obisesan Hall, Radio Nigeria, Cocoa Dome and Kingsway Paradise Club. In a corner of Ososami Road, there was a lady who had a nightclub where Rex Williams… no, not Rex Lawson, Rex Williams, another trumpeter, used to play. The Action Group hall was there. Young people were being trained how to play musical instruments, you know, in front of the Odeon Cinema. So, as I sneaked into town today, got here and saw it brimming as usual with people, people and people, after what I can call a somewhat culturally sterile interregnum. I saw that (Tunde) Odunlade is trying to bring back the good old days, doing that which was part of what developed people like me into what we have become…a kind of cultural and artistic renaissance.So, what difference is there in the city in that span of time?Jimi Solanke: The difference is clear: a majority of the people have been deculturised. They have become interested a lot more in western ways. In my culture, when you request medicine to relieve your leg pain, they will recommend a herb which may not be worth more than 50 kobos or at most N400. And when people like us, who go to consult these Babas, give them N5,000 instead of the N400, they go berserk, telling us they need no more than the N400 charged and wondering if we are stupid? You have to be explaining to them to keep the change because you know the medication will cure whatever ailment you may have and the Baba is not going to request from you any other thing after that. But the majority of the regular medicine, capsules… you use now have harmful side effects. Let’s be realistic. I am a Christian but I cannot because of that fact jettison the ways, religion and customs of my ancestors.Does that explain why you still look very much like a 40 -year old at 80?Jimi Solanke: To God be the glory. God is the secret. Again, when people have money, they spoil themselves. They just eat and eat rather carelessly. Once they have money in their pockets, the idea in their mind is ‘let us eat one of those delicious and expensive delicacies, and they will blow about N27, 000 at a go! But the stuff they consume oftentimes may be unhealthy or lack necessary nutrients that can promote their longevity. So, they just pack a lot of dangerous stuff into their systems trying to prove that they have money. That way, the majority of us eat ourselves to death. What’s wrong with eating little or denying ourselves food? That way, we relieve the body of burden. Even our Lord, Jesus Christ, went on 40 days and 40 nights fasting.You mean you fast?Jimi Solanke: I do a lot of fasting.How does it help?Jimi Solanke: This body we carry around is a machine. If you love to eat too much and feed it indiscriminately because you have money, the machine soon gets overworked and might just give up. Man does not come to this life because of ponmo and Amala, not just for bread. Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m choosy about what goes into my stomach. My diet essentially consists of green vegetables, ewedu especially. I drink ewedu like water and I do not eat any meat but fish. I hate maalu (beef). I don’t eat it at all. Even my wife, who loves ponmo, once in a while puts it on my plate. But when I finish eating, she will still come and pick the ponmo from my plate. I eat fruits, nuts, palm, and epa (groundnuts). Since days back, if two handfuls of epa get inside of me, I will live for the next two days. I never feel hungry. It’s all in the mind. The state of mind is also very important. I live a contented life. Would you believe I buy epa just to soak garri and a piece of sugar to have a meal, and I will be so contented and will sleep fine? I told my wife I didn’t want to be a landlord in my life. Now it happens that we are leaving a whole house in Ife and coming home to Ipara to build a cultural centre and to also live there.How so?Jimi Solanke: Because I believe I have something that I should do that I’ve not done.And what could that be?Jimi Solanke: I can’t even pinpoint it. It’s something between me and my God and I will do it before I leave this earth. I guess that’s why I’m still alive.Chief Ebenezer Obey and yourself are contemporaries among the pioneers of modern African music, alongside Tunji Oyelana, King Sunny Ade Haruna Ishola and Sikiru Ayinde. What do you make of the fortunes of your various genres – Apala, Fuji, Juju and folk music in contemporary musical context?Jimi Solanke: A pity majority of our children don’t have the eyes or ears to appreciate our culture. They don’t have the patience to learn anything about African traditions. All they do now is give themselves, free of charge, to foreign climes and peoples culturally different from us – US, UK and all of that. I am pained. When, as a Yoruba man, you crave or romance an alien culture for relevance, you are no more than an empty bag, cultureless, with no origin and so you end up pained and you will suffer. That’s because they have nothing original to offer or that can compete with what you have in terms of creativity and uniqueness. What do they want to do there that will be better than yours? Talking of competitiveness, the Yoruba culture is number one in the whole of Africa. It will be good for you to propagate this Yoruba cultural heritage because, in Brazil, people are studying Yoruba, in America, about 56 or 64 universities are teaching Yoruba, in Cuba, all over the world.Aren’t you afraid for the future of indigenous music and civilization with the younger generation’s apparent disinterest in them and preference for pop culture?Jimi Solanke: The Hausa do say: “Serkin Goma, Zamani Goma,” which in Yoruba translates: “Oba mewa, igba mewa”. That’s the way I see the matter. I’ve lived up to nearly eighty, I’ve seen different kinds of music evolve and last for so long and at the end of the day, they fade away or die. These hip-hop musicians you speak of, I clap for them. Whatever lyrics they put into their songs, it’s their time now. I’ve seen it before they too will evolve and realism will dawn that everything follows a pattern. That is: rise and fall.What’s the update on your novel project at Ipara? Are we having an academy or theatre village there Like Baba Hubert Ogunde’s Film Village in Ososa?Jimi Solanke: Yes, Ibudo Asa, Ipara, is a centre for creative and performing arts enhancement. Enhancement in the sense that if you’re a graduate and you are still looking for how to step in and stamp your feet on the ground of performances, come, you will get your skills enhanced. We will through a practical approach take you through the rudiments of stage presence, voice mastery, acting and total theatre experience for continuity of live stage performance. Live theatre because live theatre is all I was trained for as a young man who went into thespianism. Maybe that’s why I’m a bit more of a dramatic person even when I sing. I act everything I sing and all that. Live theatre is what I believe in most. We are not building a big academy as such, but we will be having a lot of people coming for workshops on different areas of thespian life. Everything is involved including music because music is part of theatre.So, what stage is the project now?Jimi Solanke: Well, we have put up a structure in place with rooms each having its own toilet, the ceiling’s done and the whole place wired by an electrician, Now, I have a very spacious living room about two times the size of this (Tunde Odunlade Arts Connexions Gallery’s lounge where the interview was conducted). My hall contains at least 50-60 people. We have hosted a lot of artists and visitors already. We have done book readings, and that is still testing, testing the microphone (laughs). It is the outside hall, the stage, and the sitting area that we are facing now.Which exactly is your forte or favourite mode of artistic expression – music, acting or storytelling?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me, sir, when you are a thespian, it means you are an actor, a singer, a dancer, you are everything that equals performance. When I stand before an audience and tell stories, I’m acting. Perhaps, that’s why a lot of people love me telling stories, because I act, innovate and mimic the sound of a chicken, that of a lion, and also give the tortoise a voice. It’s all part of thespianism, it’s all part of acting, it’s all part of playing a role.But there must be one that makes your heart beat in a special way.Jimi Solanke: I tell you, there’s no favourite, no distinction up till now. Music, acting, everything are all under the same umbrella. As far as I am concerned, maybe that’s the reason why God has been keeping me, to live my destiny. I sing for the sake of thespianism and not for money or anybody. It’s like fulfilling a calling or being inspired primarily to delight and add value to humanity, you know, like: “Eleyi o ko sita (Lo, sing this for the world), not like the “Onitemi o, Abiola ti de, o de towotowo, owo lo n na” lyrics of the crowd of commercial musicians. In all the plays I’ve acted in, nobody can fault any movement or any tonal quality of my delivery as an actor. My good Lord has decreed it that this man is an actor. He chose me because He was looking for who would act well. You know, honest acting, true acting, acting for the sake of acting, it’s a spiritual thing, I believe. Acting is not to show off, acting is going there to build a role from the sole of your feet to the tip of the hair on your head to everything on your fingernails.How about your favourite song?Jimi Solanke: All my songs are very much my favourites. You cannot openly say in front of all your children that this one is your favourite. As I was performing out there tonight and, as you know, my band is not even complete here. Thank God I brought one person along. We couldn’t get to play ‘Osupa’, not even ‘Ojoje’, simply because we didn’t have sequence rehearsed band to accompany it. I’ve been having hits since the days of ‘Eje ka jo’ in the 60s, you have ‘Onile Gogoro’, even right now, I am in the studio.Oh yeah, so what should we expect?Jimi Solanke: Ten tracks, ten tracks of fresh, delightful music and I am not playing exclusively with the old approach, but with a blend of the younger generation’s style. (plays back a recording of three tracks from the demo album). What do you think of it?Beautiful, nice.Jimi Solanke: We are trying to subtly infuse into their (young ones) entertainment our tradition. While we let them dance the way they know how to do it, we send in the message so it can sink when they hear it and say: “Ah, is that not that Baba?” We want to start from there to reach every depth and fibre of their being. I’m even going back into animating all the old stories with this same voice that their parents used to hear back in the years. We must try our best artistically, and intensively to make sure that we do not lose these children to alien cultures.How have you been coping with the Covid-19 pandemic, general insecurity and cash crunch being experienced in the country?Jimi Solanke: I decided to start my centre just before 2000 and things were fine then, we had jobs here, engagements there, bookings all over, and so, we started the foundation, construction and all that. We moved to the lintel stage and needed four blocks more to give us room space. We had not even done the ceiling, but we had bought a lot of things that we needed to build because then, we were buoyant. We still had money. It was exciting and I was just spending all my savings, went to POS to collect money to buy building materials. But that was where the Covid lockdown met me. By the time we came out of lockdown, we just had to manage to try and finish up some sections including painting the exterior and completing the rest of the structure.So, in a way, the Covid thing helped, because I would have used the money for other purposes. But when lockdown came, I started feeling it that, ah, this is a ‘be careful case oh’ (laughs), because we were just spending the money we had saved. So, I locked up the place and went back to Ife with my wife, because I spent all the money I made from everywhere and the income was no longer flowing in as before. So, yes, it affected all of us because there were no more bookings, no programme, nothing because they said no crowd must gather, nobody must move one arm’s length. Till now, it has not been easy even with the majority of big bands. But, as I told people “Lala to lo s’oke, o n bo ni le ni.” Lala is a shout like a rising yeeeeeeee cry. The noise will definitely and ultimately subside and get to a point where people will begin to mutter Uhn, uhn, Ahn Ahn. So that’s all about this Covid. For me, however, everything that happens in my life and surrounding, I believe was meant to be. We must still be grateful to God for everything because some are not so lucky to still be alive, some of my colleagues died…Killed by the disease…?Jimi Solanke: No, …because they could not maintain their lifestyle. Now with the insecurity in the land, one expects that our rulers from the bottom to the very top of the hierarchy should be able to put it down decisively. How can Abuja to Kaduna be unmotorable, with such money put into governors’ pockets as security funds every month, every year? And to think that the military is enjoying the best of times now. What with a lot of money they are being given, unless they want to deny that the humongous money claimed to have been given to them was false.Let’s be realistic, we are playing games with one another and they have to stop it. Some people in this country are frivolously toying with the fate of millions of Nigerians. My grandchildren, beautiful, intelligent young persons who I love so much, must not suffer from their stupidity. They have killed all that we take for granted, which gives us joy and happiness. They had done that with themselves a long time ago, they have spread it into the whole nation, killing all the universities, killing all educational facilities, knocking everything out, all of us are just going to remain an Almajiri now, which is terrible. That’s why we have to stop them. We have to stop all this. If they have no interest in getting things to be better than amassing more money to the ones they have stolen, they should not disturb and destroy us. Look at the ministers, look at all the appointments, look at everything and you will see that they have won. They are chopping Nigeria’s money. Let them be contented with that and let us be. We have resources minus oil money, minus other money, to turn our lives around positively in our part of the country. We’re tired of all this rubbish,Much more than our own broadcast media and networks, the BBC seems to be doing more for African cultures and languages with its pervasive indigenous content and programming – now we have BBC Yoruba, BBC Hausa, BBC pidgin all exhaustively covering and beaming news and other interesting aspects of the life of Nigeria and its people to millions across not just the country, but the continent, especially via its social media platforms. Apart from the possibility of BBC’s popularity rating and advert income overtaking these local stations, is the peculiar development healthy for our cultural and national development? Also, is the foreign broadcasting giant’s success not an indictment of African broadcasters’ lack of patriotism and initiative to reverse the much-criticized lopsided global information order? What exactly is their handicap? Three-in-one question there for you.Jimi Solanke: When you have a media group paid by the government not doing what is right and others not owned by the government being the ones doing that you would put money on, there’s nothing more honourable than for you to just lock up your studio. That is the kind of situation we have in Nigeria. When otherwise upright media want to speak or do what is right and look right and left and see that if they should do so, they might have ‘Dongaris’ at their offices’ doorsteps the next day or having them shut, they will not. Instead, they too will join the follow, follow the band. Look at NTA? What can they do? You see, we have been warned. We have been tortured in this space called Nigeria not to know or talk about our culture. That is why the government or the rulers chopped off the teaching of history out of our school curriculum. I’m not afraid of anybody. I am eighty years old. I have grandchildren and the truth is better told. You can’t afford to keep playing with the lives of people.Don’t you think media promoters and operators themselves have a share in the blame?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me with this your mindset and attitude of vision and mission. Do you want to know why they didn’t and couldn’t do it? You go and set up a station where you want to do it and see what will happen.DonateTEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999\n",

            " All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, Nigeria All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, NigeriaThis article briefly summarizes several relatively important solutions that can greatly facilitate COVID-19 research. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Development SupportThe global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 caused a large amount of investment and research attention to developing preventive vaccines. Among the massive achievements made by using published genomes, mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 stand out because of their better performance in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Currently, mRNA vaccine is publicly deemed as a very useful strategy in anti-SARS-CoV-2 campaigns, thereby demanding reliable technology support to drive the pressing needs in research and commercial manufacturing. Many biotech corporations like BOC Sciences have become significant contributors to the campaign by providing advanced mRNA technologies ranging from mRNA design & synthesis, in vivo delivery solutions, to mRNA vaccine production.  As the crux of successful mRNA vaccine production, the nucleic acid sequences should be synthesized with a variety of modifications so that they can be applied to different antigens. Vaccine researchers or manufacturers who call for mRNA synthesis services usually provide the DNA templates for their partners who are able to generate mRNAs later. Occasionally, mRNA is also synthesized from scratch if no templates are available. Liposome Drug Delivery SupportResearch about COVID-19 drugs is also proceeding in full swing. With the aid of liposome-based drug delivery systems, the faster and safer delivery of drugs becomes possible which tremendously speeds up the process of COVID-19 drugs from trials to market. Liposome-based mRNA delivery solutions span from custom liposome production, characterization to application. The encapsulation of mRNA into liposomes can ensure the safety and effectiveness of delivery. It has been demonstrated that cationic liposome formulations greatly promote the functional delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids to cells. Oligo Synthesis Services For COVID-19 ResearchResearchers may have custom oligo synthesis requirements for their COVID-19 research. Some may need RNA molecules with multiple chemical modifications, while others demand custom synthesis and labeling of RNA oligonucleotides. The renowned Dim-Dmoc technology is now usually applied for custom-made synthetic RNA. There is also a broad portfolio of fluorescent dye modifications and chemical modifications for the fluorescent labeling of siRNA and RNA control oligonucleotides. On the one hand, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 research, siRNA synthesis is used to study human gene function involving cell entry and host-pathogen interaction or designed to silence viral genes to ensure that off-target suppression of human genes is minimized. On the other hand, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, RNA control techniques help confirm whether researchers' diagnostic test is effective when they amplify the region of interest RNA or DNA, monitor the performance of PCR master mix, and verify that the virus detection primers are valid. ConclusionMany biotech companies have focused on the mRNA vaccine, drug, and therapy development programs during the pandemic. With their consistent contribution, more advanced and effective solutions to mitigate the plague are to be explored in the near future.\n",

            "Monday Jul 04, 2022 Scientists studying the long-term effects of COVID-19 warned that the virus could be linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.Multiple pieces of research have shown that COVID-19 has the ability to cause enduring mental health problems and cognitive impacts. A Danish study disclosed that the virus which has killed many across the globe can increase the risk of developing life-altering brain challenges.The researchers of the study analysed the data collected from 919,731 people who tested for the virus. Out of those, 43,375 positive patients were 3.5 times likelier to develop Alzheimer's and 2.6 times more likely to get Parkinson’s later in life.Even worse, the group was 4.8 times more like to go through a brain bleed. “We found support for an increased risk of being diagnosed with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19 positive compared to COVID-negative patients, which must be confirmed or refuted by large registry studies in the near future,\" said Dr Pardis Zarifkar, lead author from the Department of Neurology at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Acording to Eureka Alert, the study was presented at the 8th European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress.Sign InSign InThe Star EditionCHANGE LOCATION This copy is for your personal non-commercial use only.

            "    permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.comSigns are emerging that point to the beginnings of a summer wave of COVID-19 in Ontario, the head of the province’s science advisory table is warning.Dr. Fahad Razak, scientific director of the science table, points to a rising COVID wastewater signal, increasing test positivity and a surge of public health units experiencing exponential growth in cases.There has been a gradual increase in the provincewide wastewater signal since the beginning of June along with test positivity that has been going up for the past three to four weeks. Then there’s the fact, he says, that about 40 per cent of public health units now have a reproduction number greater than one — all amounting to evidence the province has entered another wave.“Putting all of this together, I think we’re seeing the beginning of a wave,” Razak said. “But it does not look like it has the intensity in terms of amplitude or pace of what we saw with the start of the Omicron wave. How fast it will rise and what the peak will be are unclear. “Based on everything that we’re seeing, both in Ontario and globally, this is likely to be a less severe wave than what we’ve experienced in the past with less direct pressure on the health-care system.”Razak’s red flag comes as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended this week that additional boosters be given to a larger portion of the population in the fall. Other regions are also seeing a rise in hospitalizations driven by Omicron subvariants, including Quebec, which recently experienced a surge in community transmission and cases in health-care workers. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports that infections are growing in 110 countries driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, resulting in an overall 20 per cent increase in global cases. Several infectious disease experts say fourth doses should be offered to all residents now ahead of a possible fall wave, while others say only those who are deemed at higher risk should be getting a second booster.“If you’re someone who is higher-risk or is in a situation where you’re being exposed to a lot because you’re on TTC twice a day, in and out of work or something like that, it would be very reasonable to go and get that fourth shot now,” Razak said. “On the other hand, if you are otherwise low-risk and you have very little day-to-day exposure, it is reasonable to wait to get that booster dose until you’re closer to the fall or there’s more concretely a rise happening.”At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said up-to-date vaccinations are the “foundation of our protection” and that those who had two doses and a booster shot had hospitalization rates that were five times lower than unvaccinated people during the Omicron wave in April and May.She also reiterated NACI’s recommendations that those at risk of severe illness receive a fourth shot now, as boosters “increase protection by activating your immune response to restore protection that may have decreased over time.”Dr. Gerald Evans, the chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen’s University, said it’s uncertain whether fourth doses will be effective enough against BA.4 and BA.5 for the larger population. Those subvariants have an alteration within their genomes, making it more difficult for antibodies to bind to the spike proteins, which in turn makes these variants more likely to have immune-evading properties, he explained.Pfizer and Moderna are developing vaccines that will specifically target Omicron, known as bivalent vaccines, which will likely be available in the fall. Both companies say they’ve tested their vaccines and they appear to be highly effective against Omicron, and plan to submit their data to governments in the next few months. “I do totally agree that we should be rolling out boosters in the fall,” said Evans. He predicts a wave will occur in the late fall or early winter, and another will follow in the late winter or early spring because that’s how the COVID-19 virus has behaved previously, similar to other illnesses in the coronavirus category, he said. NACI also announced in a release Wednesday that everyone aged 12 to 65 may be offered another dose in the fall, regardless of the number of previous doses, but that recommendation is “discretionary” and not categorized as a strong recommendation. Those groups include all residents over 65; people 12 and older who have underlying medical conditions; Indigenous adults; racialized and marginalized communities that have been harder hit by the virus throughout the pandemic; migrant workers; residents of shelters, correctional facilities and group homes.Recommendations will be provided on the type of COVID-19 booster dose that should be offered as evidence emerges on bivalent vaccines.NACI said in its press release that “cases of COVID-19, including associated hospitalizations and deaths, are currently declining in Canada. However, the likelihood, timing, and severity of a future wave of COVID-19 is uncertain.”Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said he is afraid the increasing signals Ontario is experiencing could mean we are approaching endemicity.“My belief is that when we took masks off on the TTC, we started to harmonize different wastewater signals across the GTA. In other words, mixing people together on the TTC is not going to cause the signal at one wastewater treatment plant to go down, it’s going to cause the other ones to come up to match,” he said.“If you think about that logically, that kind of synchronization, that’s a path to endemicity. Not a wave that comes and then subsides, but a new normal where the line is flat but it is at a very elevated level.”He added that the elevations in wastewater signals, as well as cases in public health units, reflect the dropping of mask mandates earlier this month.“But it’s not just that. It’s the mindset that goes with it. We see more and more people who ought to know better engaging in crazy, risky behaviour,” Furness said. “If I can be on the TTC and I don’t need to have a mask, then I can go out to dinner because that’s obviously less dangerous and if that’s the case, I can definitely go see a movie. “It’s causing self-destructive logic to take hold.”Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

Just 10% believe the pandemic has already ended.Over four in five people, or 82%, believe vaccines, in general, are effective while 76% of people trust the medical evidence about vaccines. Over half of people could spontaneously name four vaccine-preventable diseases, with Covid-19, measles, mumps and rubella cited most often.Just under half of people, or 48%, have not received adult vaccinations for diseases other than Covid-19. These diseases could include flu, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis B, whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.The survey finds that 91% of people have been vaccinated for Covid-19, with three in four people having received at least one booster vaccine dose for the disease. One in four people, or 25%, say they are more likely to get vaccinated for other diseases as a result of getting protected against Covid-19.\n",

However, these changes have not been thoroughly evaluated scientifically in the EMR.Objective We aim to present data on seasonal influenza activity during the pre-pandemic period (2016–2019) and compare it to the pandemic period (2020–2021) in EM countries.Methods Epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data were retrieved from both WHO FluNet and EMFLU networks. Four pre-pandemic analytical periods were used in the comparative analysis. We compiled and calculated weekly aggregated epidemiological data on the number of enrolled patients, number of tested specimens and number of positive influenza specimens.Results 19 out of the 22 countries of the EMR have functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems, and these countries report the influenza data to WHO through FluNet and EMFLU. The number of enrolled patients and tested specimens increased gradually from 51 384 and 50 672, respectively, in 2016–2017 analytical period to 194 049 enrolled patients and 124 697 tested specimens in 2019–2020. A decrease has been witnessed in both enrolled patients and tested specimens in 2020–2021 ‘pandemic period’ (166 576 and 44 764, respectively). By comparing influenza activity of analytical period 2020–2021 with that of 2016–2019 analytical periods, we found that there has been a decrease in influenza positivity rate in the EMR by 89%.Conclusion The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic may have also impacted the spread of influenza viruses. The low circulation of influenza viruses during 2020–2021 and the associated potential immunity gap may result in increased transmission and severity of post-pandemic influenza seasons. This necessitates high vigilance to continuous data and virus sharing to monitor circulating viruses in a timely fashion to reduce the intensity and severity of future influenza epidemics.Read the full report\n",

            "EastMojoHouston: Scientists in the US have developed a rapid COVID-19 test that can accurately detect all current variants of SARS-CoV-2 within hours.The test, CoVarScan, detects the signatures of eight hotspots on the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWThe researchers at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center in the US tested CoVarScan on samples collected from more than 4,000 patients.The research, published recently in the journal Clinical Chemistry, shows that the test is as accurate as other methods used to diagnose COVID-19, and can successfully differentiate between all current variants of SARS-CoV-2.“Using this test, we can determine very quickly what variants are in the community and if a new variant is emerging, said Jeffrey SoRelle, an assistant professor at UT Southwestern, and senior author of the study.“It also has implications for individual patients when we are dealing with variants that respond differently to treatments,” SoRelle said.While a number of other tests for COVID-19 exist, they generally detect either a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material or small molecules found on the surface of the virus, and don’t provide information to identify the variant.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWIn addition, many researchers worry that these tests are not accurate in detecting some variants, or may miss future strains.To determine which variant of COVID-19 a patient has, scientists typically must use whole genome sequencing, which is time-consuming and expensive, relying on sophisticated equipment and analysis to spell out the entire RNA sequence contained in the viruses.CoVarScan hones in on eight regions of SARS-CoV-2 that commonly differ between viral variants.It detects small mutations — where the sequence of RNA building blocks varies — and measures the length of repetitive genetic regions that tend to grow and shrink as the virus evolves.The method relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — a technique common in most pathology labs — to copy and measure the RNA at these eight sites of interest.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWSoRelle’s team ran the test on over 4,000 COVID-19-positive nasal swab samples collected at UT Southwestern from April 2021 to February 2022 — from patients both with and without symptoms.The tests were validated with the gold-standard whole genome sequencing, and the results were used by doctors to choose treatments in some critically ill COVID-19 patients.Compared to whole genome sequencing, CoVarScan had 96 per cent sensitivity and 99 per cent specificity.It identified and differentiated Delta, Mu, Lambda, and Omicron variants of COVID-19, including the BA.2 version of Omicron, once known as “stealth Omicron because it did not show up on some tests designed to detect only the Omicron strain.“A common critique of this kind of test is that it requires constant adjustment for new variants, but CoVarScan has not needed any adjustment in more than a year; it is still performing very well, said SoRelle.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOW“In the future, if we did need to adjust it, we could easily add as many as 20 or 30 additional hotspots to the test,” he added.SoRelle plans to continue developing CoVarScan as a commercial test and has a pending patent application based on this work.Also read: Watch: Three injured in attack over pet dog in Delhi, video goes viralLatest StoriesPlay real money online casino games at Pure Win, where everyone can win real rupee cash prizes!

            "Grievance RedressalMANILA, Philippines — An adviser to the pandemic task force recommended that the government keeps Alert Level 1 across most of the country even as COVID-19 cases rise, saying that this is not a cause for alarm while the number of severe cases and hospital utilization rates remain low.Dr. Edsel Salvaña, who is an infectious diseases expert, said vaccines against the coronavirus have kept severe COVID-19 cases low, protecting the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.“Because of vaccines, because of boosting, severe cases remain low,” Salvaña said partly in Filipino over state-run People’s Television on Tuesday. “Even if cases increase to 2,000 or 5,000, we don’t expect it to overwhelm the healthcare system and we do not need to lock down.”Most of the country, including Metro Manila will remain under Alert Level 1 until July 15.From June 27 to July 3, COVID-19 cases in the Philippines rose by 60% to 7,398 additional cases from 4,634 cases logged from June 20 to 26, according to the Department of Health.But of the total cases 497 or only 8.4% of total COVID-19 patients have severe and critical disease, while 15.3% of 2,487 beds in intensive care units are in use and only 19.9% of non-ICU beds are in use.“Don’t panic. Nothing good ever comes out of panicking,” Salvaña said.He said people should continue using masks and get boosted against the coronavirus if they have not done so already.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. still has not appointed a health chief amid the ongoing pandemic, but the DOH said Monday that its senior career officials are leading its COVID-19 response and other operations in the meantime. — Xave GregorioPhilstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.

            "                    In a recent article posted to the medRxiv* preprint server, researchers in the United States analyzed the pneumococcal carriage in older adults in the Greater New Haven Area, United States (US), during the implementation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation strategies.Study: Persistence of pneumococcal carriage among older adults in the community despite COVID-19 mitigation measures. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / ShutterstockThe COVID-19 mitigation strategies significantly impacted other infectious disease incidences. Major respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza, largely vanished as disease-causing agents in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter of 2020–21. All age categories experienced a substantial fall in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the 2020 spring. It did not reach almost normal levels again until the 2021 spring/summer.There was a significant rate of pneumococcus transmission across children in the initial year of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Yet, social distancing and other COVID-19 mitigation approaches might have decreased the frequency of interaction and pneumococcal transmission from children to adults.The rapid decline in adult pneumococcal illness after vaccinating children with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines made it clear that children represent a significant source of pneumococcus exposure for adults. Nevertheless, the prevalence of pneumococcus across older adults during this time is uncertain.In the present study, the researchers at Yale University and Pfizer Inc hypothesized that some of the decreases in IPD seen in adult populations may have resulted from diminished contact between adults and children during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, the team assessed the pneumococcal carriage rates of persons aged 60 years or older who were enrolled in an active longitudinal pneumococcal carriage research and lived in the community in the US in the years 2020–21. Study objectives included measuring and identifying pneumococcal carriage rates among older adults and assessing household transmission among cohabiting older adults.From October 2020 to August 2021, the authors recruited couples residing in the Greater New Haven Area who were both 60 years or older and without residents under 60 years in their households. The participation of the household pair in the study was postponed by around four weeks if they had signs of a respiratory infection at the time of registering, received a pneumococcal vaccination, or had recently taken antibiotics during the previous four weeks. No subjects were excluded from the investigation based on comorbidity status.For 10 weeks, questionnaires about social activities, interactions, and health history were collected every two weeks, along with saliva samples. Additionally, all spit samples were checked for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) utilizing the extraction-free Saliva Direct test. After culture enrichment, collected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was examined for the pneumococcus-specific sequences: lytA, and piaB, employing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Study volunteers were regarded positive for pneumococcal carriage when cycle threshold (Ct)-values for piaB were <40.The authors noted that in the current research, older individuals living in the community remained pneumococcus-positive at rates comparable with other pre-pandemic experiments of elderly persons that used similar molecular techniques. This was contrary to the significant drop in reported IPD rates among adults in the first winter season of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., 2020–21. Moreover, the team mentioned that the current investigation was performed when SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related transmission mitigation techniques were in effect.The study results indicated that the scientists procured 567 saliva samples from 95 adults aged 60 years or older from one singleton and 47 household pairs. Among these samples, 7.1% were pneumococcus-positive containing either just piaB (six samples) or both lytA and piaB (34 samples), comprising 22/95, or 23.2%, of the individuals and 16/48, or 33.3%, of the households during the 10-week long trial. Study volunteers attended a few social gatherings during this time. Many participants, nevertheless, still had frequent interactions with children. People who regularly interacted with two to 9-year-olds, i.e., preschool and school-aged children, had a greater rate of pneumococcus carriage, i.e., 15.9% versus 5.4%.According to the study findings, the Greater New Haven Area's older adults often had pneumococcus infections in the 10-week study period, despite SARS-CoV-2-linked disruptions. Those who interacted with school-aged children notably had a higher prevalence, but this group was not the only ones affected.The researchers discovered little indication of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts on rates of pneumococcal carriage in older individuals in the first research period of an ongoing investigation examining rates of pneumococcal carriage in Greater New Haven. The study findings imply that school-aged children were the most likely source of the pneumococcus that persisted in most study participants during the time of decreased social contact.The high frequency of the non-specific signal found in the commonly used lytA qPCR test highlights the significance of focusing on several gene targets for accurate and precise pneumococcus detection in oral samples. Additional research using molecular serotyping of the procured samples will shed more light on this observation and the pneumococcal transmission patterns in households with only people over 60 years.medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.Posted in: Men's Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women's Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Children, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, covid-19, CT, DNA, Frequency, Gene, Influenza, Pandemic, Pneumococcal Disease, Polymerase, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Research, Respiratory, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Syndrome, VirusWritten byShanet Susan Alex, a medical writer, based in Kerala, India, is a Doctor of Pharmacy graduate from Kerala University of Health Sciences.

So what, if anything, is being done to slow the death toll?\"If you've had two or one, and you haven't had your full three, putting it bluntly – you're crazy,\" Mr Hazzard said.\"That is what is going to make a difference to stopping or reducing the chances of you ending up in hospital or ending up possibly dying.\"Dr Chant said two doses were appropriate for the Delta variant but were no longer enough to protect against severe disease from Omicron variants. \"Disregard anything we said about two doses. It's three doses or more,\" she said.\"And as ATAGI continues to watch the evidence they might broaden the criteria ... for further vaccines.\"Mr Hazzard said he did not want to see any new mandates or rules imposed to combat the next wave.\"We saw the results in some states, not so much in NSW but in other states, where people saw the requirements imposed on them were challenging,\" he said.\"I think most people are pretty sensible.\"Fourteen people with COVID have died in NSW in the last 24 hours and 58 people with the virus are currently in intensive care units, 18 more people than a week ago.In NSW, 1,782 people with COVID are in hospital, although that number includes people who were hospitalised for other reasons.While more than 95 per cent of the state's eligible population has received two doses of a COVID vaccine, just 68 per cent are considered 'up to date' with their third dose.A fourth dose is currently available for people who are immunocompromised or with a significant medical condition, people over 65 and those in aged care homes, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over 50 years old.Many epidemiologists say current scientific evidence shows while a fourth dose is helpful in some demographics to prevent severe disease, it doesn't do much to prevent disease in younger, healthy people.See our full coverage of coronavirusWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)Another wave of Covid-19 could be on its way with a new Omicron subvariant seeing case numbers back on the rise. Video / NZ Herald / Ben CumminsMultimedia JournalistA Covid expert says he is not ruling out New Zealand going back into red within the next few weeks as Covid numbers continue to rise.There are 9629 new community cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand today - up by more than 3000 from yesterday.The regions with the most new cases in the past 24 hours are Canterbury, with 1549 cases, and Waitematā, with 1266.Auckland recorded 924 cases, Capital and Coast had 827, Southern 809 and Counties Manukau 731 new infections.The worst-affected region remains Auckland, with 15,983 people infected with Covid.University of Auckland senior lecturer in computational evolution Dr David Welch has been mapping the emergence of the BA.5 Omicron subvariant and its contribution to the rise in Covid numbers.\"Going back to red is something that the Government would be looking at very closely right now, they'd be looking at how the hospitals are coping and what are the projections,\" Welch said.\"Our hospitals are already really, really full. Not only because of Covid but also because of other winter illnesses. We expect these cases to continue to rise and there'll be just more pressure on the health system.\"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the rise in case numbers was \"no expectation\" of moving to red.Last week, Covid-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said: \"When we moved out of red in April the rolling average of cases was nearly 10,000 a day and there were over 500 people in hospital including 28 in ICU\".The Ministry of Health today also reported a further 24 Covid-related deaths. Of the 24 deaths, three people were in their 40s, five were in their 70s, seven in their 80s, and nine were aged over 90.There are 493 people in hospital with the virus, including 11 in intensive care.And the Omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has been detected in New Zealand for the first time.Welch said it was the BA.5 Omicron subvariant that \"we should be worried about\".It is appearing as more transmissible and will overtake BA.2 to be the dominant variant in a matter of weeks, he said.\"It's now gotten close to the point where BA.5 is becoming the dominant variant, and so that's why we are seeing the case numbers going up,\" he said.\"The BA.2.75 is yet another variant, and one that we're watching closely and it's just kind of come to the attention of people around the world. In terms of what's happening here, it won't be having an impact on case numbers right now.\"The ministry says at this stage, there is no evidence BA.2.75 requires a shift in the public health settings already in place to manage other Omicron variants.On Friday afternoon, analysis of whole genome sequencing confirmed two cases in New Zealand with BA.2.75. Before testing positive for Covid-19, both had recently travelled from India.BA.2.75 is a recently identified second-generation subvariant of BA.2, the dominant variant circulating in New Zealand at this stage. BA.2.75 has only been recently identified as distinct from BA.2, and evidence on its transmissibility, immune evasiveness and severity is still preliminary and emerging.\"I certainly won't rule out going back into red within the next few weeks, but then again I'm not sure if it is politically feasible and whether people will listen this time,\" Welch said.\"But there are a lot of things that people can do without having to wait for the Government to make it mandatory, like mask-wearing at schools, for example. Anecdotally, schools that have made masking mandatory have not had the illnesses that other schools have.\"Red is the most restrictive traffic light setting, where face coverings are mandatory when travelling on public transport, in retail and to an extent in education. Public facilities and retail outlets are open, with capacity limits.Welch said everyone who is eligible for boosters should be taking them - especially those who can now get the fourth vaccination jab.\"People need to reset and recalibrate their risk level. We have been so used to going out and about a bit more, and that was fine when case numbers were lower and decreasing,\" Welch said.\"Now we're in a situation where they are higher and increasing and people should reconsider when they should be getting into that crowded environment, and when they should be wearing that mask or not.\"\r\n",

            "                    In a recent study published in The Lancet, researchers in the United Kingdom determined whether an individual with a higher body mass index (BMI) mounted a weaker immune response to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Additionally, they investigated vaccine uptake and the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in such individuals.Study: Associations of BMI with COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England: a population-based cohort study. Image Credit: GrooTrai / ShutterstockBy 2021, around 82.5% of the United Kingdom (UK) population had received a two-dose regimen of COVID-19 vaccines. However, there is no information about the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for the nine million UK population stratified by BMI groups.Studies have shown that the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is lower among individuals with a higher BMI. Since COVID-19 is also a respiratory infection; therefore, it warrants investigation of whether there is an association between BMI and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE). In addition, the long-term evidence across a range of COVID-19 outcomes in all BMI groups is also needed because it might reveal the need for alternative risk mitigation strategies and targeted vaccine booster programs for people at high risk.In the present observational cohort study, researchers used the QResearch database of general practice records to identify individuals for whom the BMI data was available and who were vaccinated between December 8, 2020, and November 17, 2021, in England. They calculated vaccine uptake as the fraction of individuals with zero, one, two, or three vaccine doses across four BMI categories. The BMI categories were - underweight (<18.5kg/m2), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9kg/ m2), overweight (25 to 29kg/ m2) , and obese (>30kg/ m2). The study analysis accounted for several demographic confounders, including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and relevant comorbidities.The team also investigated VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Further, using a matched case-control design, they estimated the odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 outcomes in vaccinated individuals vis-à-vis those who had not, considering vaccine dosage and time elapsed since vaccination. Lastly, they estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes associated with BMI following vaccination using multivariable cox proportional hazard models.Of 9,171,524 participants, 5,666,461 were COVID-19 positive during the study duration. Eventually, 32,808 COVID-19 positive participants were hospitalized, and 14,389 died. Of all the study participants, 19.2% were unvaccinated. Of the remaining participants, 3.1%, 52.6%, and 25% received one, two, and three vaccine dose(s), respectively. The average age of the study participants was 52 years, and the average BMI was 26.7 kg/m².Proportion of people who received no, one, two, or three vaccination doses by age and BMI groupThe vaccine uptake was lower in underweight people compared to overweight or obese people (70 to 83% vs. over 80%). These individuals were 40 years or older and had received two or three vaccine doses. Across all four BMI groups, the study results were significantly heterogeneous concerning protection against severe COVID-19.Accordingly, hospitalization ORs for underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.51, 0.34, 0.32, and 0.32, respectively. Likewise, ORs of COVID-19-related death for under-weight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.60, 0.39, 0.30, and 0.26, respectively. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, hospitalization and death were higher after 14 days of the second vaccine dose in vaccinated individuals. Also, in the vaccinated participants, the correlation between BMI and COVID-19 hospitalization and death was linear after the first and J-shaped after the second vaccine dose. The researchers observed an inverse U-shaped association between BMI and the third vaccine dose, indicating that a booster was needed to confer complete protection in obese people.Furthermore, the first and second sets of sensitivity analyses used two different cohorts. The first set had individuals for whom the BMI records for two years before cohort enrollment were available. Their VE showed smaller ORs compared with the primary study analysis; however, the results of both sensitivity analyses were generally in agreement with the main study findings.Risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 after vaccination Estimates of risk after 14 days from each vaccine dose. Adjusted for age, calendar week, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, smoking status, hypertension, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and care home status. Hospital admissions from COVID-19 after first dose (A), second dose (B), and third dose (C), and deaths from COVID-19 after first dose (D), second dose (E), and third dose (F).The current large population-based cohort study evidenced that COVID-19 vaccines confer protection against severe disease; however, of similar magnitude in obese as well as normal-weight people. However, the VE had reduced for underweight individuals among those with lower vaccine uptake across all ages. Moreover, the study findings pointed to a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 in obese and underweight people in the vaccinated cohort because they had lower vaccine uptake and showed much reduced VE. Overall, these results highlighted the need for concerted efforts to increase vaccine uptake in people with BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2. Indeed, creating awareness among people to maintain a healthy weight could help lessen the COVID-19 burden.Posted in: Child Health News | Men's Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women's Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Body Mass Index, Cardiovascular Disease, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, Diabetes, Hospital, Immune Response, Influenza, Respiratory, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Smoking, Syndrome, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, VaccineWritten byNeha is a digital marketing professional based in Gurugram, India.

Health Minister Adrian Dix is considering making COVID-19 shots widely available in the fall, as experts predict a third Omicron wave is on the way.The provincial health-care system is getting ready for a fall wave and looking at a federal advisory body's recommendations that booster doses be made widely available, Dix said speaking at a news conference Monday.Meanwhile, the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group, made up of interdisciplinary experts who work independently from the government, warns that a wave of COVID-19 driven by the more infectious and immune-evasive BA.5 sub-variant of Omicron is emerging.Dix said everyone should plan to get another vaccine dose in the fall. \"We have to protect the ones we love and to protect ourselves in a pandemic that is still with us, still affecting us.\"Dix did not provide any further information about whether the doses would be targeted toward BA.5 specifically, or how they would be rolled out.It comes as the province is preparing to dispose of more than 200,000 vaccine doses amid a slow uptake of third and fourth shots.Public Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said two weeks ago that those hoping for a fourth dose would still have to wait until they are eligible. They are currently only available for people aged 70 and older, Indigenous people over 55, and people in long-term care — six months after their last booster.Dix also said the province wouldn't rule out bringing back masks in indoor spaces come the fall and encouraged people to get vaccinated.About 1.4 million people who are eligible for a third dose have not taken it, Dix said, adding that vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19.Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, said people should take precautions — especially to avoid getting long COVID.\"I don't want to hear on the street, as I hear often: 'Thank God it's over.' It's not over. It may never be fully over,\" he said. \"Most experts are suggesting that there will be a significant increase in transmission in the fall.\"COVID-19 is having a significant effect on the province's health-care workers, Dix said. Numerous emergency rooms and acute care units have been closed in B.C. over the past few weeks due to staff shortages.\"There were 16,400 people who missed at least one day due to illness last week in our public health-care system,\" he said. \"That's on a base of about 160,000 workers … so about 10.2 per cent.\"Normally it would be about six per cent, he said, adding that COVID-19 is contributing to the rising numbers.Asked what the province is doing to avert the closures, Dix pointed to new hiring initiatives.\"We're going to continue to do that work in communities to make sure that people are safe, our workers are safe, and most importantly, patients are safe,\" said Dix, who was speaking at a press conference announcing a new hospital in Surrey, about 34 km southeast of Vancouver, which is expected to begin construction next summer.With files from Jessica CheungAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

            "\tIn a statement to CTV News Ottawa on Monday, deputy medical officer of health Dr. Brent Moloughney said OPH is monitoring rising levels of the virus in the community.\r\n",
            "\t\"As we enter a new wave, it’s important to consider your risk, and the risk of those around you when gathering. Ottawa Public Health continues to highly recommend people keep practicing the measures that we know work – being up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations, limiting close contacts, staying home if you’re not feeling well, avoiding crowded areas, and wearing a mask,\" he said.\r\n",
            "\tOPH's COVID-19 dashboard only updates on Tuesdays and Fridays and there was no update on Canada Day. As of last Tuesday's report, OPH was reporting an increase in the number of confirmed cases reported per day and an increase in the positivity rate of people who are still being tested.\r\n",
            "\tThe number of new cases reported the week of June 19 was 423, slightly higher than the peak of the Sept. 2021 wave, but still well below the all-time high of 7,000 cases reported the week of Dec. 26, 2021. Testing eligibility was looser in 2021 than it is now and laboratory-confirmed case counts in 2022 are generally considered an underrepresentation of the amount of COVID-19 in the community.\r\n",
            "\tThe Ottawa COVID-19 wastewater monitoring project’s latest data show the seven-day mean viral signal detected in the city’s sewage as of last week was almost as high as it was at the peak of the January 2022 wave, but it remains below the April 2022 wave that saw the viral signal hit an unprecedented high.\r\n",
            "\tThe number of COVID-19 hospitalizations remained low as of last week’s report from OPH. As of June 28, OPH has recorded 74,866 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 819 residents of Ottawa have died from the disease.\r\n",
            "\tAt least 209 residents of Ottawa have died of COVID-19 so far in 2022, compared to 228 in all of 2021 and 381 between March and December 2020.\r\n",
            "\tMoloughney’s comment comes amid discussion around expanding COVID-19 vaccine booster dose eligibility to allow residents 18 and older to receive a fourth dose. Currently, fourth doses are not available to any under the age of 60 in Ontario.\r\n",
            "\tCanada’s Chief Medical Officer and the National Advisory Council on Immunization (NACI) are telling provinces to launch booster dose campaigns in the fall, but some experts are calling for boosters to be made more widely available now.\r\n",
            "\tOttawa epidemiologist Dr. Raywat Deonandan told Newstalk 580 CFRA on Sunday that the fall is too late to start boosters with a wave on the way, and Ottawa physician Dr. Nili Kaplan-Myrth has said she’d bring legal action against the provincial government if booster eligibility remains restricted much longer.\r\n",
            "\t“Waiting until the fall, when we’re told that it’s going to be really bad in the fall, is ridiculous; we should be able to access the vaccine now,” Kaplan-Myrth says. \r\n",

            " All rights reserved. Use of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy PolicyIf you've noticed your kids are getting sick more often lately, you're likely not the only one. P.E.I.'s College of Family Physicians says doctors have been seeing a high number of children with non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses recently.Dr. Heather Austin, president of the college, said there are a number of factors that could be contributing to the increase, including the fact that throughout the pandemic children have had little exposure to these respiratory viruses. \"We are seeing a lot of upper respiratory illnesses within our population at this point in time,\" she said.She said the lifting of mandates and public health restrictions also plays a role.\"Mostly it is moving away from the mandatory masking regulations and having us be in close proximity and able to spread all of the different viruses and pathogens that are in our environment to each other again.\" Austin said many older people have built up an immunity to many of these viruses, but when it comes to children some are likely being exposed to certain viruses for the first, second or third time. \"They don't have that same built-up immunity so they're more likely to develop an infection from an exposure,\" she said. Austin also said it may seem like children are catching colds or illnesses that simply won't go away. But it's more likely that the child is actually being infected with a number of different viruses, one after the other. According to the province's latest flu data, there have been 50 lab-confirmed cases of the flu for the 2021-2022 season. The median age of those cases is about 12 years old. The spike in respiratory illnesses is something emergency room physician, Dr. Trevor Jain has noticed as well. \"For the last six weeks we've seen an uptick in respiratory illnesses in the pediatric population and that mostly has to do with mandates changing,\" Jain said. He said it is unusual to see increased respiratory illness at this time of year. Typically infections of flu and other viruses spike fall, winter or early spring among children, Jain said. \"We're talking anything from the common cold to RSV [respiratory syncytial virus , to croup, increased asthma due to viral infections, even some pneumonia,\" he said.\"That was a little unexpected but when you think about it, you know we have increased mixing of the population, dropping of mandates so it just goes to show that those public health measures pre-vaccination were very effective at limiting the spread of respiratory illnesses.\" Jain said the emergency room is now starting to see the number of admissions for respiratory illnesses go down. Dr. Austin said typically a virus could involve mild symptoms over three to five days, like a low-grade fever, congestion, cough, sore throat and a runny nose. Coughing can sometimes last for up to three weeks in some cases and just as the child is recovering, they pick up another virus. \"The times when you'd want to seek medical attention would be a persistent fever, certainly a fever beyond five days,\" Austin said. \"If they're very lethargic, sleepy, not themselves, not eating and drinking in the usual way.\"She said if a child is in pain or struggling to breath they should also get medical attention.To limit the spread of respiratory illness, Austin said people should make sure they are washing their hands regularly and to stay home if they feel unwell.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Wachter, Chair of UCSF Department of Medicine, stands for a portrait on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020 in San Francisco, Calif.The new BA.5 strain of the COVID-causing virus is “a different beast” from ones we’ve already seen — more infectious and better able to evade immune responses — and “we need to change our thinking” about how to defend against it, according to a data-packed Twitter thread posted today by Dr. Bob Wachter, UCSF’s chair of medicine.BA.5, a sub-variant of the Omicron family which has an altered version of the virus’s infamous “spike” protein, will soon become the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S., meaning that “its behavior will determine our fate for the next few months, until it either burns itself out by infecting so many people or is replaced by a variant that’s even better at infecting people,” Wachter wrote.“Neither is a joyful scenario,” he added.The number of new COVID cases per day has plateaued nationally and is down significantly since January. The same is true for the number of COVID hospitalizations in the UCSF health system, Watchter said. However, the true spread of COVID is harder to know these days, because so many people are testing themselves with at-home kits.And BA.5 could cause a continued plateau, or even a new surge of infections and possibly hospitalizations, because it infects more easily and also is better at evading immune responses — even in vaccinated people, Wachter wrote.While he stressed that vaccines and vaccine booster shots “remain hugely valuable in preventing a severe case” that might lead to hospitalization or death, the increased slippieriness of BA.5 means that existing vaccines will probably be less effective at preventing mild COVID cases or stopping transmission in the first place. Also, he wrote, prior infection by a different variant “no longer provides robust protection from reinfection” with BA.5.What should a person do, then?COVID-19 Map: Data on trends in the Bay Area and across CaliforniaLatest news: Complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemicWachter said it depends on how badly you want to avoid getting COVID. Personally, he said, he doesn’t want to risk getting “Long COVID” and the debilitating symptoms that come with it, “So I still avoid indoor dining & will continue to wear an N95 in crowded indoor spaces until cases come way down.” Others might make different choices.As for governments, he said, if BA.5 causes a surge in hospitalizations, “particularly if we also have staff shortages,” a return to mask mandates “would be the right call.” But Wachter acknowledged there would likely be fierce resistance to new mask-wearing requirements, especially outside of blue states, regardless of the danger.“Most people have ditched their masks,” he wrote.Jason Fagone (he/him) is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

            " Gordon Deegan Up to 40 people were present in a marquee for a late night \"prisoner release party\" going at \"full throttle\" during a strict Covid-19 lockdown, a court has heard.Sgt Claire Heneghan told Ennis District Court she saw flashing disco lights and heard very loud music when she first called to the address at St Enda’s, Beechpark, on the outskirts of Ennis, Co Clare on February 8th, 2021. She said most of the 30 to 40 people at the event appeared to be drinking alcohol.Sgt Heneghan said on the night she was approached by Rose Joyce (53), who said she was staging the event \"for a son who was released from prison earlier that day\".In court, Ms Joyce – who lives at the address – denied saying this and also denied staging an organised event in breach of Covid-19 health regulations when such gatherings were banned.The country was in a Covid lockdown at the time and Judge Alec Gabbett convicted Ms Joyce of staging the event in contravention of Covid-19 regulations and fined her €200.Judge Gabbett said Sgt Heneghan “had been more than fair to Ms Joyce on the night”.The judge said: “When Sgt Heneghan called at 10.37pm the party was at half throttle and Sgt Heneghan had asked Ms Joyce to turn the music down but when she returned at 11.37pm the party was at full throttle”.Judge Gabbett said when Sgt Heneghan called at 11.37pm “the party was still going hard and heavy”.Sgt Heneghan said when she called at 11.37pm, the disco lights were still flashing and the music was still very loud. She said she returned after gardaí received numerous complaints about loud music at the address.She said she directed that the party cease and people were to leave.Sgt Heneghan said she was satisfied that an illegal organised event was taking place in breach of Covid-19 regulations.The Garda Sargeant told the court that Ms Joyce – represented by solicitor, Tara Godfrey – told her that she would have the music turned down but said she wasn’t doing anything wrong as it was all the one family.However, Sgt Heneghan said despite the request that the party cease, the party continued for a number of hours until the early hours.Sgt Heneghan told the court that she issued a Fixed Charge Penalty Notice to Ms Joyce the following day and it remains unpaid resulting in the issuing of the court summons.Want us to email you top stories each lunch time? Toronto/IBNS: A notification reportedly posted to social media by Toronto public health said it will be shortening hours at the city-run immunization clinics during the summer. According to the post, the new hours of operation will begin on Monday and will impact all of the six active clinics offering the COVID-19 vaccine. The new hours are as follows: Both the Metro Hall and Crossroads Plaza clinics will be open between noon to 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. The clinics at Cloverdale Mall, Mitchell Field Community Centre, and 1940 Eglinton Avenue, will be operational from noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. At Thorncliffe Park Community Hub, the clinic will be open between noon to 6 p.m., as well as between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday. All clinics are offering first, second and third doses, as well as fourth doses for select eligible groups. Residents are asked to book an appointment using the provincial booking portal or call centre. Appointments at these clinics for school-based vaccinations such as those for Hepatitis B, HPV, and Meningococcal diseases can also be booked by students in Grades 7 to 12. About 51.7 per cent of all eligible Toronto residents have received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

            "Photo / SuppliedNorthern Advocate Multimedia JournalistNorthland health providers are begging the public to get the flu vaccine to prevent serious illness as the health system fights a twindemic of flu and Covid 19.The calls come as reports emerge that Whangārei Hospital has been treating patients in tents and corridors as virus infections surge.Bush Rd Medical Centre GP Dr Geoff Cunningham said the twindemic along with Northland's long-running GP shortage has doctors struggling to keep up.\"It's having a massive impact, we're just frantically busy.\"The problem is that we can't be sure what's Covid and what's flu.\"The symptoms of both viruses overlap, but you often can't tell from your symptoms which virus you have.\"We're seeing a lot of very sick people with influenza.\"We couldn't be busier and the normal general practice work doesn't stop.\"Cunningham also works at White Cross after-hours medical centre, which is facing similar issues.\"We've got staff shortages at White Cross necessitating early closes, unfortunately.\"Primary care is the cornerstone of the healthcare system and if that falls over, we can all see what's happening.\"Epidemiologist Michael Baker has called for mandatory 7-day isolation for those who contract the flu, treating the illness the same way we deal with Covid-19.\"That's probably not unreasonable,\" Cunningham said of Baker's flu isolation idea.\"The severity of influenza that we're seeing in patients is reasonably similar to what we're seeing in the Omicron variant of Covid.\"Cunningham said the flu jab is the best way to avoid becoming severely ill if you catch the flu, or even catching it all together,\"The flu jab is always your best protection against influenza.\"It's strongly recommended, we consider it essential.\"\"If people aren't overly unwell, they can just do sensible self-care, that's staying at home, paracetamol, fluids.\"Of course, if they're really concerned and they're getting increasingly unwell we need to and want to see them.\"Far North health provider Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa spokesman Raniera Kaio said the increase in demand for support was being felt by the team's nurses.\"There's been an uptake in the number of calls and appointments through our health service, just in regard to the fact that they can't get an appointment with the doctors... because there is so much flu around as well as Covid.\"The nurses are managing at the moment, but they definitely can see that this will not last long term, it will be a clear drain on our resources both human and otherwise.\"The Māori health organization in Kāeo is waiting with crossed fingers for increased support under the new Health NZ oversight as promised in the Government's 2022 Budget.\"A small health provider service like ours runs on a team of five, one of them goes down (with illness) it's sort of dominoes from there.\"It's not all bad news for the Far North. Kaio said the team had a successful response to community immunisation.\"Last month we had a bit of an immunization drive... leading into winter and autumn.\"(We) delivered, I think twice as many flu vaccines as we did last year.\"The health provider has also seen success with its mobile health service, delivering the flu vaccine to the rural Far North community.\"They've seen those numbers and requests for the flu vaccine out as far north as Hihi.\"\"The public definitely recognized that this was going to be a problem this year.\"Anyone over six months can have a flu vaccine according to the Ministry of Health.Do you have cold or flu symptoms?

Where the Lekan Salami Stadium is now was a location where we (artists) all ended up in the evenings, coming from all over the town to enjoy ourselves. When you are tired of that place, you can walk down and get to Keru’s hotel. Baba Keru on Ife road. Reverse, and you are at Ekotedo Iya Olobe, there is a bubbling spot there. Reverse again and you would touch West end where Mbari Club from which all of us grew up to know what the depth of cultural involvement is.Go up, you will see the Obisesan Hall, Radio Nigeria, Cocoa Dome and Kingsway Paradise Club. In a corner of Ososami Road, there was a lady who had a nightclub where Rex Williams… no, not Rex Lawson, Rex Williams, another trumpeter, used to play. The Action Group hall was there. Young people were being trained how to play musical instruments, you know, in front of the Odeon Cinema. So, as I sneaked into town today, got here and saw it brimming as usual with people, people and people, after what I can call a somewhat culturally sterile interregnum. I saw that (Tunde) Odunlade is trying to bring back the good old days, doing that which was part of what developed people like me into what we have become…a kind of cultural and artistic renaissance.So, what difference is there in the city in that span of time?Jimi Solanke: The difference is clear: a majority of the people have been deculturised. They have become interested a lot more in western ways. In my culture, when you request medicine to relieve your leg pain, they will recommend a herb which may not be worth more than 50 kobos or at most N400. And when people like us, who go to consult these Babas, give them N5,000 instead of the N400, they go berserk, telling us they need no more than the N400 charged and wondering if we are stupid? You have to be explaining to them to keep the change because you know the medication will cure whatever ailment you may have and the Baba is not going to request from you any other thing after that. But the majority of the regular medicine, capsules… you use now have harmful side effects. Let’s be realistic. I am a Christian but I cannot because of that fact jettison the ways, religion and customs of my ancestors.Does that explain why you still look very much like a 40 -year old at 80?Jimi Solanke: To God be the glory. God is the secret. Again, when people have money, they spoil themselves. They just eat and eat rather carelessly. Once they have money in their pockets, the idea in their mind is ‘let us eat one of those delicious and expensive delicacies, and they will blow about N27, 000 at a go! But the stuff they consume oftentimes may be unhealthy or lack necessary nutrients that can promote their longevity. So, they just pack a lot of dangerous stuff into their systems trying to prove that they have money. That way, the majority of us eat ourselves to death. What’s wrong with eating little or denying ourselves food? That way, we relieve the body of burden. Even our Lord, Jesus Christ, went on 40 days and 40 nights fasting.You mean you fast?Jimi Solanke: I do a lot of fasting.How does it help?Jimi Solanke: This body we carry around is a machine. If you love to eat too much and feed it indiscriminately because you have money, the machine soon gets overworked and might just give up. Man does not come to this life because of ponmo and Amala, not just for bread. Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m choosy about what goes into my stomach. My diet essentially consists of green vegetables, ewedu especially. I drink ewedu like water and I do not eat any meat but fish. I hate maalu (beef). I don’t eat it at all. Even my wife, who loves ponmo, once in a while puts it on my plate. But when I finish eating, she will still come and pick the ponmo from my plate. I eat fruits, nuts, palm, and epa (groundnuts). Since days back, if two handfuls of epa get inside of me, I will live for the next two days. I never feel hungry. It’s all in the mind. The state of mind is also very important. I live a contented life. Would you believe I buy epa just to soak garri and a piece of sugar to have a meal, and I will be so contented and will sleep fine? I told my wife I didn’t want to be a landlord in my life. Now it happens that we are leaving a whole house in Ife and coming home to Ipara to build a cultural centre and to also live there.How so?Jimi Solanke: Because I believe I have something that I should do that I’ve not done.And what could that be?Jimi Solanke: I can’t even pinpoint it. It’s something between me and my God and I will do it before I leave this earth. I guess that’s why I’m still alive.Chief Ebenezer Obey and yourself are contemporaries among the pioneers of modern African music, alongside Tunji Oyelana, King Sunny Ade Haruna Ishola and Sikiru Ayinde. What do you make of the fortunes of your various genres – Apala, Fuji, Juju and folk music in contemporary musical context?Jimi Solanke: A pity majority of our children don’t have the eyes or ears to appreciate our culture. They don’t have the patience to learn anything about African traditions. All they do now is give themselves, free of charge, to foreign climes and peoples culturally different from us – US, UK and all of that. I am pained. When, as a Yoruba man, you crave or romance an alien culture for relevance, you are no more than an empty bag, cultureless, with no origin and so you end up pained and you will suffer. That’s because they have nothing original to offer or that can compete with what you have in terms of creativity and uniqueness. What do they want to do there that will be better than yours? Talking of competitiveness, the Yoruba culture is number one in the whole of Africa. It will be good for you to propagate this Yoruba cultural heritage because, in Brazil, people are studying Yoruba, in America, about 56 or 64 universities are teaching Yoruba, in Cuba, all over the world.Aren’t you afraid for the future of indigenous music and civilization with the younger generation’s apparent disinterest in them and preference for pop culture?Jimi Solanke: The Hausa do say: “Serkin Goma, Zamani Goma,” which in Yoruba translates: “Oba mewa, igba mewa”. That’s the way I see the matter. I’ve lived up to nearly eighty, I’ve seen different kinds of music evolve and last for so long and at the end of the day, they fade away or die. These hip-hop musicians you speak of, I clap for them. Whatever lyrics they put into their songs, it’s their time now. I’ve seen it before they too will evolve and realism will dawn that everything follows a pattern. That is: rise and fall.What’s the update on your novel project at Ipara? Are we having an academy or theatre village there Like Baba Hubert Ogunde’s Film Village in Ososa?Jimi Solanke: Yes, Ibudo Asa, Ipara, is a centre for creative and performing arts enhancement. Enhancement in the sense that if you’re a graduate and you are still looking for how to step in and stamp your feet on the ground of performances, come, you will get your skills enhanced. We will through a practical approach take you through the rudiments of stage presence, voice mastery, acting and total theatre experience for continuity of live stage performance. Live theatre because live theatre is all I was trained for as a young man who went into thespianism. Maybe that’s why I’m a bit more of a dramatic person even when I sing. I act everything I sing and all that. Live theatre is what I believe in most. We are not building a big academy as such, but we will be having a lot of people coming for workshops on different areas of thespian life. Everything is involved including music because music is part of theatre.So, what stage is the project now?Jimi Solanke: Well, we have put up a structure in place with rooms each having its own toilet, the ceiling’s done and the whole place wired by an electrician, Now, I have a very spacious living room about two times the size of this (Tunde Odunlade Arts Connexions Gallery’s lounge where the interview was conducted). My hall contains at least 50-60 people. We have hosted a lot of artists and visitors already. We have done book readings, and that is still testing, testing the microphone (laughs). It is the outside hall, the stage, and the sitting area that we are facing now.Which exactly is your forte or favourite mode of artistic expression – music, acting or storytelling?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me, sir, when you are a thespian, it means you are an actor, a singer, a dancer, you are everything that equals performance. When I stand before an audience and tell stories, I’m acting. Perhaps, that’s why a lot of people love me telling stories, because I act, innovate and mimic the sound of a chicken, that of a lion, and also give the tortoise a voice. It’s all part of thespianism, it’s all part of acting, it’s all part of playing a role.But there must be one that makes your heart beat in a special way.Jimi Solanke: I tell you, there’s no favourite, no distinction up till now. Music, acting, everything are all under the same umbrella. As far as I am concerned, maybe that’s the reason why God has been keeping me, to live my destiny. I sing for the sake of thespianism and not for money or anybody. It’s like fulfilling a calling or being inspired primarily to delight and add value to humanity, you know, like: “Eleyi o ko sita (Lo, sing this for the world), not like the “Onitemi o, Abiola ti de, o de towotowo, owo lo n na” lyrics of the crowd of commercial musicians. In all the plays I’ve acted in, nobody can fault any movement or any tonal quality of my delivery as an actor. My good Lord has decreed it that this man is an actor. He chose me because He was looking for who would act well. You know, honest acting, true acting, acting for the sake of acting, it’s a spiritual thing, I believe. Acting is not to show off, acting is going there to build a role from the sole of your feet to the tip of the hair on your head to everything on your fingernails.How about your favourite song?Jimi Solanke: All my songs are very much my favourites. You cannot openly say in front of all your children that this one is your favourite. As I was performing out there tonight and, as you know, my band is not even complete here. Thank God I brought one person along. We couldn’t get to play ‘Osupa’, not even ‘Ojoje’, simply because we didn’t have sequence rehearsed band to accompany it. I’ve been having hits since the days of ‘Eje ka jo’ in the 60s, you have ‘Onile Gogoro’, even right now, I am in the studio.Oh yeah, so what should we expect?Jimi Solanke: Ten tracks, ten tracks of fresh, delightful music and I am not playing exclusively with the old approach, but with a blend of the younger generation’s style. (plays back a recording of three tracks from the demo album). What do you think of it?Beautiful, nice.Jimi Solanke: We are trying to subtly infuse into their (young ones) entertainment our tradition. While we let them dance the way they know how to do it, we send in the message so it can sink when they hear it and say: “Ah, is that not that Baba?” We want to start from there to reach every depth and fibre of their being. I’m even going back into animating all the old stories with this same voice that their parents used to hear back in the years. We must try our best artistically, and intensively to make sure that we do not lose these children to alien cultures.How have you been coping with the Covid-19 pandemic, general insecurity and cash crunch being experienced in the country?Jimi Solanke: I decided to start my centre just before 2000 and things were fine then, we had jobs here, engagements there, bookings all over, and so, we started the foundation, construction and all that. We moved to the lintel stage and needed four blocks more to give us room space. We had not even done the ceiling, but we had bought a lot of things that we needed to build because then, we were buoyant. We still had money. It was exciting and I was just spending all my savings, went to POS to collect money to buy building materials. But that was where the Covid lockdown met me. By the time we came out of lockdown, we just had to manage to try and finish up some sections including painting the exterior and completing the rest of the structure.So, in a way, the Covid thing helped, because I would have used the money for other purposes. But when lockdown came, I started feeling it that, ah, this is a ‘be careful case oh’ (laughs), because we were just spending the money we had saved. So, I locked up the place and went back to Ife with my wife, because I spent all the money I made from everywhere and the income was no longer flowing in as before. So, yes, it affected all of us because there were no more bookings, no programme, nothing because they said no crowd must gather, nobody must move one arm’s length. Till now, it has not been easy even with the majority of big bands. But, as I told people “Lala to lo s’oke, o n bo ni le ni.” Lala is a shout like a rising yeeeeeeee cry. The noise will definitely and ultimately subside and get to a point where people will begin to mutter Uhn, uhn, Ahn Ahn. So that’s all about this Covid. For me, however, everything that happens in my life and surrounding, I believe was meant to be. We must still be grateful to God for everything because some are not so lucky to still be alive, some of my colleagues died…Killed by the disease…?Jimi Solanke: No, …because they could not maintain their lifestyle. Now with the insecurity in the land, one expects that our rulers from the bottom to the very top of the hierarchy should be able to put it down decisively. How can Abuja to Kaduna be unmotorable, with such money put into governors’ pockets as security funds every month, every year? And to think that the military is enjoying the best of times now. What with a lot of money they are being given, unless they want to deny that the humongous money claimed to have been given to them was false.Let’s be realistic, we are playing games with one another and they have to stop it. Some people in this country are frivolously toying with the fate of millions of Nigerians. My grandchildren, beautiful, intelligent young persons who I love so much, must not suffer from their stupidity. They have killed all that we take for granted, which gives us joy and happiness. They had done that with themselves a long time ago, they have spread it into the whole nation, killing all the universities, killing all educational facilities, knocking everything out, all of us are just going to remain an Almajiri now, which is terrible. That’s why we have to stop them. We have to stop all this. If they have no interest in getting things to be better than amassing more money to the ones they have stolen, they should not disturb and destroy us. Look at the ministers, look at all the appointments, look at everything and you will see that they have won. They are chopping Nigeria’s money. Let them be contented with that and let us be. We have resources minus oil money, minus other money, to turn our lives around positively in our part of the country. We’re tired of all this rubbish,Much more than our own broadcast media and networks, the BBC seems to be doing more for African cultures and languages with its pervasive indigenous content and programming – now we have BBC Yoruba, BBC Hausa, BBC pidgin all exhaustively covering and beaming news and other interesting aspects of the life of Nigeria and its people to millions across not just the country, but the continent, especially via its social media platforms. Apart from the possibility of BBC’s popularity rating and advert income overtaking these local stations, is the peculiar development healthy for our cultural and national development? Also, is the foreign broadcasting giant’s success not an indictment of African broadcasters’ lack of patriotism and initiative to reverse the much-criticized lopsided global information order? What exactly is their handicap? Three-in-one question there for you.Jimi Solanke: When you have a media group paid by the government not doing what is right and others not owned by the government being the ones doing that you would put money on, there’s nothing more honourable than for you to just lock up your studio. That is the kind of situation we have in Nigeria. When otherwise upright media want to speak or do what is right and look right and left and see that if they should do so, they might have ‘Dongaris’ at their offices’ doorsteps the next day or having them shut, they will not. Instead, they too will join the follow, follow the band. Look at NTA? What can they do? You see, we have been warned. We have been tortured in this space called Nigeria not to know or talk about our culture. That is why the government or the rulers chopped off the teaching of history out of our school curriculum. I’m not afraid of anybody. I am eighty years old. I have grandchildren and the truth is better told. You can’t afford to keep playing with the lives of people.Don’t you think media promoters and operators themselves have a share in the blame?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me with this your mindset and attitude of vision and mission. Do you want to know why they didn’t and couldn’t do it? You go and set up a station where you want to do it and see what will happen.DonateTEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999\n",

            " All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, Nigeria All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, NigeriaThis article briefly summarizes several relatively important solutions that can greatly facilitate COVID-19 research. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Development SupportThe global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 caused a large amount of investment and research attention to developing preventive vaccines. Among the massive achievements made by using published genomes, mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 stand out because of their better performance in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Currently, mRNA vaccine is publicly deemed as a very useful strategy in anti-SARS-CoV-2 campaigns, thereby demanding reliable technology support to drive the pressing needs in research and commercial manufacturing. Many biotech corporations like BOC Sciences have become significant contributors to the campaign by providing advanced mRNA technologies ranging from mRNA design & synthesis, in vivo delivery solutions, to mRNA vaccine production.  As the crux of successful mRNA vaccine production, the nucleic acid sequences should be synthesized with a variety of modifications so that they can be applied to different antigens. Vaccine researchers or manufacturers who call for mRNA synthesis services usually provide the DNA templates for their partners who are able to generate mRNAs later. Occasionally, mRNA is also synthesized from scratch if no templates are available. Liposome Drug Delivery SupportResearch about COVID-19 drugs is also proceeding in full swing. With the aid of liposome-based drug delivery systems, the faster and safer delivery of drugs becomes possible which tremendously speeds up the process of COVID-19 drugs from trials to market. Liposome-based mRNA delivery solutions span from custom liposome production, characterization to application. The encapsulation of mRNA into liposomes can ensure the safety and effectiveness of delivery. It has been demonstrated that cationic liposome formulations greatly promote the functional delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids to cells. Oligo Synthesis Services For COVID-19 ResearchResearchers may have custom oligo synthesis requirements for their COVID-19 research. Some may need RNA molecules with multiple chemical modifications, while others demand custom synthesis and labeling of RNA oligonucleotides. The renowned Dim-Dmoc technology is now usually applied for custom-made synthetic RNA. There is also a broad portfolio of fluorescent dye modifications and chemical modifications for the fluorescent labeling of siRNA and RNA control oligonucleotides. On the one hand, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 research, siRNA synthesis is used to study human gene function involving cell entry and host-pathogen interaction or designed to silence viral genes to ensure that off-target suppression of human genes is minimized. On the other hand, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, RNA control techniques help confirm whether researchers' diagnostic test is effective when they amplify the region of interest RNA or DNA, monitor the performance of PCR master mix, and verify that the virus detection primers are valid. ConclusionMany biotech companies have focused on the mRNA vaccine, drug, and therapy development programs during the pandemic. With their consistent contribution, more advanced and effective solutions to mitigate the plague are to be explored in the near future.\n",

            "Monday Jul 04, 2022 Scientists studying the long-term effects of COVID-19 warned that the virus could be linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.Multiple pieces of research have shown that COVID-19 has the ability to cause enduring mental health problems and cognitive impacts. A Danish study disclosed that the virus which has killed many across the globe can increase the risk of developing life-altering brain challenges.The researchers of the study analysed the data collected from 919,731 people who tested for the virus. Out of those, 43,375 positive patients were 3.5 times likelier to develop Alzheimer's and 2.6 times more likely to get Parkinson’s later in life.Even worse, the group was 4.8 times more like to go through a brain bleed. “We found support for an increased risk of being diagnosed with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19 positive compared to COVID-negative patients, which must be confirmed or refuted by large registry studies in the near future,\" said Dr Pardis Zarifkar, lead author from the Department of Neurology at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Acording to Eureka Alert, the study was presented at the 8th European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress.Sign InSign InThe Star EditionCHANGE LOCATION This copy is for your personal non-commercial use only.

            "    permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.comSigns are emerging that point to the beginnings of a summer wave of COVID-19 in Ontario, the head of the province’s science advisory table is warning.Dr. Fahad Razak, scientific director of the science table, points to a rising COVID wastewater signal, increasing test positivity and a surge of public health units experiencing exponential growth in cases.There has been a gradual increase in the provincewide wastewater signal since the beginning of June along with test positivity that has been going up for the past three to four weeks. Then there’s the fact, he says, that about 40 per cent of public health units now have a reproduction number greater than one — all amounting to evidence the province has entered another wave.“Putting all of this together, I think we’re seeing the beginning of a wave,” Razak said. “But it does not look like it has the intensity in terms of amplitude or pace of what we saw with the start of the Omicron wave. How fast it will rise and what the peak will be are unclear. “Based on everything that we’re seeing, both in Ontario and globally, this is likely to be a less severe wave than what we’ve experienced in the past with less direct pressure on the health-care system.”Razak’s red flag comes as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended this week that additional boosters be given to a larger portion of the population in the fall. Other regions are also seeing a rise in hospitalizations driven by Omicron subvariants, including Quebec, which recently experienced a surge in community transmission and cases in health-care workers. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports that infections are growing in 110 countries driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, resulting in an overall 20 per cent increase in global cases. Several infectious disease experts say fourth doses should be offered to all residents now ahead of a possible fall wave, while others say only those who are deemed at higher risk should be getting a second booster.“If you’re someone who is higher-risk or is in a situation where you’re being exposed to a lot because you’re on TTC twice a day, in and out of work or something like that, it would be very reasonable to go and get that fourth shot now,” Razak said. “On the other hand, if you are otherwise low-risk and you have very little day-to-day exposure, it is reasonable to wait to get that booster dose until you’re closer to the fall or there’s more concretely a rise happening.”At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said up-to-date vaccinations are the “foundation of our protection” and that those who had two doses and a booster shot had hospitalization rates that were five times lower than unvaccinated people during the Omicron wave in April and May.She also reiterated NACI’s recommendations that those at risk of severe illness receive a fourth shot now, as boosters “increase protection by activating your immune response to restore protection that may have decreased over time.”Dr. Gerald Evans, the chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen’s University, said it’s uncertain whether fourth doses will be effective enough against BA.4 and BA.5 for the larger population. Those subvariants have an alteration within their genomes, making it more difficult for antibodies to bind to the spike proteins, which in turn makes these variants more likely to have immune-evading properties, he explained.Pfizer and Moderna are developing vaccines that will specifically target Omicron, known as bivalent vaccines, which will likely be available in the fall. Both companies say they’ve tested their vaccines and they appear to be highly effective against Omicron, and plan to submit their data to governments in the next few months. “I do totally agree that we should be rolling out boosters in the fall,” said Evans. He predicts a wave will occur in the late fall or early winter, and another will follow in the late winter or early spring because that’s how the COVID-19 virus has behaved previously, similar to other illnesses in the coronavirus category, he said. NACI also announced in a release Wednesday that everyone aged 12 to 65 may be offered another dose in the fall, regardless of the number of previous doses, but that recommendation is “discretionary” and not categorized as a strong recommendation. Those groups include all residents over 65; people 12 and older who have underlying medical conditions; Indigenous adults; racialized and marginalized communities that have been harder hit by the virus throughout the pandemic; migrant workers; residents of shelters, correctional facilities and group homes.Recommendations will be provided on the type of COVID-19 booster dose that should be offered as evidence emerges on bivalent vaccines.NACI said in its press release that “cases of COVID-19, including associated hospitalizations and deaths, are currently declining in Canada. However, the likelihood, timing, and severity of a future wave of COVID-19 is uncertain.”Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said he is afraid the increasing signals Ontario is experiencing could mean we are approaching endemicity.“My belief is that when we took masks off on the TTC, we started to harmonize different wastewater signals across the GTA. In other words, mixing people together on the TTC is not going to cause the signal at one wastewater treatment plant to go down, it’s going to cause the other ones to come up to match,” he said.“If you think about that logically, that kind of synchronization, that’s a path to endemicity. Not a wave that comes and then subsides, but a new normal where the line is flat but it is at a very elevated level.”He added that the elevations in wastewater signals, as well as cases in public health units, reflect the dropping of mask mandates earlier this month.“But it’s not just that. It’s the mindset that goes with it. We see more and more people who ought to know better engaging in crazy, risky behaviour,” Furness said. “If I can be on the TTC and I don’t need to have a mask, then I can go out to dinner because that’s obviously less dangerous and if that’s the case, I can definitely go see a movie. “It’s causing self-destructive logic to take hold.”Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

Just 10% believe the pandemic has already ended.Over four in five people, or 82%, believe vaccines, in general, are effective while 76% of people trust the medical evidence about vaccines. Over half of people could spontaneously name four vaccine-preventable diseases, with Covid-19, measles, mumps and rubella cited most often.Just under half of people, or 48%, have not received adult vaccinations for diseases other than Covid-19. These diseases could include flu, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis B, whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.The survey finds that 91% of people have been vaccinated for Covid-19, with three in four people having received at least one booster vaccine dose for the disease. One in four people, or 25%, say they are more likely to get vaccinated for other diseases as a result of getting protected against Covid-19.\n",

However, these changes have not been thoroughly evaluated scientifically in the EMR.Objective We aim to present data on seasonal influenza activity during the pre-pandemic period (2016–2019) and compare it to the pandemic period (2020–2021) in EM countries.Methods Epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data were retrieved from both WHO FluNet and EMFLU networks. Four pre-pandemic analytical periods were used in the comparative analysis. We compiled and calculated weekly aggregated epidemiological data on the number of enrolled patients, number of tested specimens and number of positive influenza specimens.Results 19 out of the 22 countries of the EMR have functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems, and these countries report the influenza data to WHO through FluNet and EMFLU. The number of enrolled patients and tested specimens increased gradually from 51 384 and 50 672, respectively, in 2016–2017 analytical period to 194 049 enrolled patients and 124 697 tested specimens in 2019–2020. A decrease has been witnessed in both enrolled patients and tested specimens in 2020–2021 ‘pandemic period’ (166 576 and 44 764, respectively). By comparing influenza activity of analytical period 2020–2021 with that of 2016–2019 analytical periods, we found that there has been a decrease in influenza positivity rate in the EMR by 89%.Conclusion The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic may have also impacted the spread of influenza viruses. The low circulation of influenza viruses during 2020–2021 and the associated potential immunity gap may result in increased transmission and severity of post-pandemic influenza seasons. This necessitates high vigilance to continuous data and virus sharing to monitor circulating viruses in a timely fashion to reduce the intensity and severity of future influenza epidemics.Read the full report\n",

              "'EastMojoHouston:\\xa0Scientists in the US have developed a rapid COVID-19 test that can accurately detect all current variants of SARS-CoV-2 within hours.The test, CoVarScan, detects the signatures of eight hotspots on the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWThe researchers at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center in the US tested CoVarScan on samples collected from more than 4,000 patients.The research, published recently in the journal Clinical Chemistry, shows that the test is as accurate as other methods used to diagnose COVID-19, and can successfully differentiate between all current variants of SARS-CoV-2.“Using this test, we can determine very quickly what variants are in the community and if a new variant is emerging, said Jeffrey SoRelle, an assistant professor at UT Southwestern, and senior author of the study.“It also has implications for individual patients when we are dealing with variants that respond differently to treatments,” SoRelle said.While a number of other tests for COVID-19 exist, they generally detect either a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material or small molecules found on the surface of the virus, and don’t provide information to identify the variant.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWIn addition, many researchers worry that these tests are not accurate in detecting some variants, or may miss future strains.To determine which variant of COVID-19 a patient has, scientists typically must use whole genome sequencing, which is time-consuming and expensive, relying on sophisticated equipment and analysis to spell out the entire RNA sequence contained in the viruses.CoVarScan hones in on eight regions of SARS-CoV-2 that commonly differ between viral variants.It detects small mutations — where the sequence of RNA building blocks varies — and measures the length of repetitive genetic regions that tend to grow and shrink as the virus evolves.The method relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — a technique common in most pathology labs — to copy and measure the RNA at these eight sites of interest.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOWSoRelle’s team ran the test on over 4,000 COVID-19-positive nasal swab samples collected at UT Southwestern from April 2021 to February 2022 — from patients both with and without symptoms.The tests were validated with the gold-standard whole genome sequencing, and the results were used by doctors to choose treatments in some critically ill COVID-19 patients.Compared to whole genome sequencing, CoVarScan had 96 per cent sensitivity and 99 per cent specificity.It identified and differentiated Delta, Mu, Lambda, and Omicron variants of COVID-19, including the BA.2 version of Omicron, once known as “stealth Omicron because it did not show up on some tests designed to detect only the Omicron strain.“A common critique of this kind of test is that it requires constant adjustment for new variants, but CoVarScan has not needed any adjustment in more than a year; it is still performing very well, said SoRelle.ADVERTISEMENTCONTINUE READING BELOW“In the future, if we did need to adjust it, we could easily add as many as 20 or 30 additional hotspots to the test,” he added.SoRelle plans to continue developing CoVarScan as a commercial test and has a pending patent application based on this work.Also read: Watch: Three injured in attack over pet dog in Delhi, video goes viralLatest StoriesPlay real money online casino games at Pure Win, where everyone can win real rupee cash prizes!

Nothing good ever comes out of panicking,” Salvaña said.He said people should continue using masks and get boosted against the coronavirus if they have not done so already.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. still has not appointed a health chief amid the ongoing pandemic, but the DOH said Monday that its senior career officials are leading its COVID-19 response and other operations in the meantime. — Xave GregorioPhilstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.

Image Credit:\\xa0Kateryna Kon\\xa0/ ShutterstockThe COVID-19 mitigation strategies significantly impacted other infectious disease incidences. Major respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza, largely vanished as disease-causing agents in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter of 2020–21. All age categories experienced a substantial fall in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the 2020 spring. It did not reach almost normal levels again until the 2021 spring/summer.There was a significant rate of pneumococcus transmission across children in the initial\\xa0year of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\\xa0pandemic. Yet, social distancing\\xa0and other COVID-19 mitigation approaches might have decreased the frequency of interaction and pneumococcal transmission from children to adults.The rapid decline in adult pneumococcal illness after vaccinating children with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines made it clear that children represent a significant source of pneumococcus exposure for adults. Nevertheless, the prevalence of pneumococcus across older adults during this time is uncertain.In the present study, the researchers at Yale University and Pfizer Inc hypothesized that some of the decreases in IPD seen in adult populations may have resulted from diminished contact between adults and children during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, the team assessed the pneumococcal carriage rates of persons aged 60 years or older who were enrolled in an active longitudinal pneumococcal carriage research and lived in the community in the US in the years 2020–21. Study objectives included measuring and identifying pneumococcal carriage rates among older adults and assessing household transmission among cohabiting older adults.From October 2020 to August 2021, the authors recruited couples residing in the Greater New Haven Area who were both 60 years or older and without residents under 60 years in their households. The participation of the household pair in\\xa0the study was postponed by around\\xa0four weeks if they had signs of a respiratory infection at the time of registering, received a pneumococcal vaccination, or had recently taken antibiotics during the previous four weeks. No subjects were excluded from the investigation based on comorbidity status.For 10 weeks, questionnaires about social activities, interactions, and health history were collected every two weeks, along with saliva samples. Additionally, all spit samples were checked for SARS-CoV-2\\xa0ribonucleic acid (RNA) utilizing the extraction-free Saliva Direct test.\\xa0After culture enrichment, collected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was examined for the pneumococcus-specific sequences: lytA, and piaB, employing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Study volunteers were regarded positive for pneumococcal carriage when cycle threshold (Ct)-values for piaB were <40.The authors noted that in the current research, older individuals living in the community remained pneumococcus-positive at rates comparable with other pre-pandemic experiments of elderly persons that used similar molecular techniques. This was contrary to the\\xa0significant drop in reported IPD rates among\\xa0adults in the first winter season of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., 2020–21. Moreover, the team mentioned that the current investigation was performed when SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related transmission mitigation techniques were in effect.The study results indicated that the scientists procured 567 saliva samples from 95 adults aged 60 years or older from one singleton and 47 household pairs. Among these samples, 7.1% were pneumococcus-positive containing either just piaB (six samples) or both lytA and piaB (34 samples), comprising 22/95, or 23.2%, of the individuals and 16/48, or 33.3%, of the households during the 10-week long trial.\\xa0Study volunteers attended a few social gatherings during this time. Many participants, nevertheless, still had frequent interactions with children. People who regularly interacted with two to 9-year-olds, i.e., preschool and school-aged children, had a greater rate of pneumococcus carriage, i.e., 15.9% versus 5.4%.According to the study findings, the Greater New Haven Area\\'s older adults often had pneumococcus infections in the 10-week study period, despite SARS-CoV-2-linked disruptions. Those who interacted with school-aged children notably had a higher prevalence, but this group was not the only ones affected.The researchers discovered little indication of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts on rates of pneumococcal carriage in older individuals in the first research period of an ongoing investigation examining rates of pneumococcal carriage in Greater New Haven. The study findings imply that school-aged children were the most likely source of the pneumococcus that persisted in most study participants during the time of decreased social contact.The high frequency of the non-specific signal found in the commonly used lytA qPCR test highlights the significance of focusing on several gene targets for accurate and precise pneumococcus detection in oral samples. Additional research using molecular serotyping of the procured samples will shed more light on this observation and the pneumococcal transmission patterns in households with only people over 60 years.medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.Posted in: Men\\'s Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women\\'s Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Children, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, covid-19, CT, DNA, Frequency, Gene, Influenza, Pandemic, Pneumococcal Disease, Polymerase, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Research, Respiratory, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Ribonucleic Acid, RNA, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Syndrome, VirusWritten byShanet Susan Alex, a medical writer, based in Kerala, India, is a Doctor of Pharmacy graduate from Kerala University of Health Sciences.

So what, if anything, is being done to slow the death toll?\"If you\\'ve had two or one, and you haven\\'t had your full three, putting it bluntly – you\\'re crazy,\" Mr Hazzard said.\"That is what is going to make a difference to stopping or reducing the chances of you ending up in hospital or ending up possibly dying.\"Dr Chant said two doses were appropriate for the Delta variant but were no longer enough to protect against severe disease from Omicron variants.\\xa0\"Disregard anything we said about two doses.

Video / NZ Herald / Ben CumminsMultimedia JournalistA Covid expert says he is not ruling out New Zealand going back into red within the next few weeks as Covid numbers continue to rise.There are 9629 new community cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand today - up by more than 3000 from yesterday.The regions with the most new cases in the past 24 hours are Canterbury, with 1549 cases, and Waitematā, with 1266.Auckland recorded 924 cases, Capital and Coast had 827, Southern 809 and Counties Manukau 731 new infections.The worst-affected region remains Auckland, with 15,983 people infected with Covid.University of Auckland senior lecturer in computational evolution Dr David Welch has been mapping the emergence of the BA.5 Omicron subvariant and its contribution to the rise in Covid numbers.\"Going back to red is something that the Government would be looking at very closely right now, they\\'d be looking at how the hospitals are coping and what are the projections,\" Welch said.\"Our hospitals are already really, really full. Not only because of Covid but also because of other winter illnesses. We expect these cases to continue to rise and there\\'ll be just more pressure on the health system.\"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the rise in case numbers was \"no expectation\" of moving to red.Last week, Covid-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall said: \"When we moved out of red in April the rolling average of cases was nearly 10,000 a day and there were over 500 people in hospital including 28 in ICU\".The Ministry of Health today also reported a further 24 Covid-related deaths. Of the 24 deaths, three people were in their 40s, five were in their 70s, seven in their 80s, and nine were aged over 90.There are 493 people in hospital with the virus, including 11 in intensive care.And the Omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has been detected in New Zealand for the first time.Welch said it was the BA.5 Omicron subvariant that \"we should be worried about\".It is appearing as more transmissible and will overtake BA.2 to be the dominant variant in a matter of weeks, he said.\"It\\'s now gotten close to the point where BA.5 is becoming the dominant variant, and so that\\'s why we are seeing the case numbers going up,\" he said.\"The BA.2.75 is yet another variant, and one that we\\'re watching closely and it\\'s just kind of come to the attention of people around the world. In terms of what\\'s happening here, it won\\'t be having an impact on case numbers right now.\"The ministry says at this stage, there is no evidence BA.2.75 requires a shift in the public health settings already in place to manage other Omicron variants.On Friday afternoon, analysis of whole genome sequencing confirmed two cases in New Zealand with BA.2.75. Before testing positive for Covid-19, both had recently travelled from India.BA.2.75 is a recently identified second-generation subvariant of BA.2, the dominant variant circulating in New Zealand at this stage. BA.2.75 has only been recently identified as distinct from BA.2, and evidence on its transmissibility, immune evasiveness and severity is still preliminary and emerging.\"I certainly won\\'t rule out going back into red within the next few weeks, but then again I\\'m not sure if it is politically feasible and whether people will listen this time,\" Welch said.\"But there are a lot of things that people can do without having to wait for the Government to make it mandatory, like mask-wearing at schools, for example. Anecdotally, schools that have made masking mandatory have not had the illnesses that other schools have.\"Red is the most restrictive traffic light setting, where face coverings are mandatory when travelling on public transport, in retail and to an extent in education. Public facilities and retail outlets are open, with capacity limits.Welch said everyone who is eligible for boosters should be taking them - especially those who can now get the fourth vaccination jab.\"People need to reset and recalibrate their risk level. We have been so used to going out and about a bit more, and that was fine when case numbers were lower and decreasing,\" Welch said.\"Now we\\'re in a situation where they are higher and increasing and people should reconsider when they should be getting into that crowded environment, and when they should be wearing that mask or not.\"\\r\\n                        We use cookies to enhance your experience.

Additionally, they investigated vaccine uptake and the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in such individuals.Study: Associations of BMI with COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England: a population-based cohort study. Image Credit:\\xa0GrooTrai\\xa0/ ShutterstockBy 2021, around 82.5% of the United Kingdom (UK) population had received a two-dose regimen of COVID-19 vaccines. However, there is no information about the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination for the nine million UK population stratified by BMI groups.Studies have shown that the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is lower among individuals with a higher BMI. Since COVID-19 is also a respiratory infection; therefore, it warrants investigation of whether there is an association between BMI and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE). In addition, the long-term evidence across a range of COVID-19 outcomes in all BMI groups is also needed because it might reveal the need for alternative risk mitigation strategies and targeted vaccine booster programs for people at high risk.In the present observational cohort study, researchers used the QResearch database of general practice records to identify individuals for whom the BMI data was available and who were vaccinated between December 8, 2020, and November 17, 2021, in England. They calculated vaccine uptake as the fraction of individuals with zero, one, two, or three vaccine doses across four BMI categories. The BMI categories were - underweight (<18.5kg/m2), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9kg/ m2), overweight (25 to 29kg/ m2) , and obese (>30kg/ m2). The study analysis accounted for several demographic confounders, including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and relevant comorbidities.The team also investigated VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Further, using a matched case-control design, they estimated the odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-19 outcomes in vaccinated individuals vis-à-vis those who had not, considering vaccine dosage and time elapsed since vaccination. Lastly, they estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes associated with BMI following vaccination using multivariable cox proportional hazard models.Of 9,171,524 participants, 5,666,461 were COVID-19 positive during the study duration. Eventually, 32,808 COVID-19 positive participants were hospitalized, and 14,389 died. Of all the study participants, 19.2% were unvaccinated. Of the remaining participants, 3.1%, 52.6%, and 25% received one, two, and three vaccine dose(s), respectively. The average age of the study participants was 52 years, and the average BMI was 26.7 kg/m².Proportion of people who received no, one, two, or three vaccination doses by age and BMI groupThe vaccine uptake was lower in underweight people compared to overweight or obese people (70 to 83% vs. over 80%). These individuals were 40 years or older and had received two or three vaccine doses. Across all four BMI groups, the study results were significantly heterogeneous concerning protection against severe COVID-19.Accordingly, hospitalization ORs for underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.51, 0.34, 0.32, and 0.32, respectively. Likewise, ORs of COVID-19-related death for under-weight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese were 0.60, 0.39, 0.30, and 0.26, respectively. Compared to unvaccinated individuals, hospitalization and death were higher after 14 days of the second vaccine dose in vaccinated individuals. Also, in the vaccinated participants, the correlation between BMI and COVID-19 hospitalization and death was linear after the first and J-shaped after the second vaccine dose. The researchers observed an inverse U-shaped association between BMI and the third vaccine dose, indicating that a booster was needed to confer complete protection in obese people.Furthermore, the first and second sets of sensitivity analyses used two different cohorts. The first set had individuals for whom the BMI records for two years before cohort enrollment were available. Their VE showed smaller ORs compared with the primary study analysis; however, the results of both sensitivity analyses were generally in agreement with the main study findings.Risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 after vaccination Estimates of risk after 14 days from each vaccine dose. Adjusted for age, calendar week, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, smoking status, hypertension, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and care home status. Hospital admissions from COVID-19 after first dose (A), second dose (B), and third dose (C), and deaths from COVID-19 after first dose (D), second dose (E), and third dose (F).The current large population-based cohort study evidenced that COVID-19 vaccines confer protection against severe disease; however, of similar magnitude in obese as well as normal-weight people. However, the VE had reduced for underweight individuals among those with lower vaccine uptake across all ages. Moreover, the study findings pointed to a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 in obese and underweight people in the vaccinated cohort because they had lower vaccine uptake and showed much reduced VE. Overall, these results highlighted the need for concerted efforts to increase vaccine uptake in people with BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2. Indeed, creating awareness among people to maintain a healthy weight could help lessen the COVID-19 burden.Posted in: Child Health News | Men\\'s Health News | Medical Research News | Medical Condition News | Women\\'s Health News | Disease/Infection NewsTags: Body Mass Index, Cardiovascular Disease, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19, Diabetes, Hospital, Immune Response, Influenza, Respiratory, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Smoking, Syndrome, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, VaccineWritten byNeha is a digital marketing professional based in Gurugram, India.

Health Minister Adrian Dix is considering making COVID-19 shots widely available in the fall, as experts predict a third Omicron wave is on the\\xa0way.The provincial health-care\\xa0system is getting ready for a fall wave and looking at a\\xa0federal advisory body\\'s recommendations that booster doses be made widely available, Dix said speaking at a news conference Monday.Meanwhile,\\xa0the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group, made up of interdisciplinary experts who work independently from the government,\\xa0warns that\\xa0a wave of COVID-19 driven by the more infectious and immune-evasive BA.5 sub-variant of Omicron is emerging.Dix said everyone should plan to get another vaccine dose in the fall.\\xa0\"We have to protect the ones we love and to protect ourselves in a pandemic that is still with us, still affecting us.\"Dix did not provide any further information\\xa0about whether the doses\\xa0would be targeted toward\\xa0BA.5 specifically, or how they would\\xa0be rolled out.It comes as the province is preparing to dispose of more than 200,000 vaccine doses amid a slow uptake of third and fourth shots.Public Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said two weeks ago that those hoping\\xa0for a fourth dose would still have to wait until\\xa0they are eligible. They are currently only available for\\xa0people aged 70 and older, Indigenous people over 55, and people in long-term care — six months after their last booster.Dix also said the province wouldn\\'t rule out bringing back masks in indoor spaces come the fall and encouraged people to get vaccinated.About 1.4 million people who are eligible for a third dose have not taken it, Dix said,\\xa0adding that\\xa0vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19.Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, said people should take precautions\\xa0—\\xa0especially to avoid getting\\xa0long COVID.\"I don\\'t want to hear on the street, as I hear often:\\xa0\\'Thank God it\\'s over.\\'\\xa0It\\'s not over. It may never be fully over,\" he said. \"Most experts are suggesting that there will be a significant increase in transmission in the fall.\"COVID-19 is having a significant effect on the province\\'s health-care workers, Dix said. Numerous emergency rooms and acute care units have been closed in B.C. over the past few weeks due to staff shortages.\"There were 16,400 people who missed at least one day due to illness last week in our public health-care system,\" he said. \"That\\'s on a base of about 160,000 workers … so about 10.2 per cent.\"Normally it would be about six per cent, he said, adding that COVID-19 is contributing to the rising numbers.Asked what the province is doing to avert the closures, Dix\\xa0pointed to new hiring initiatives.\"We\\'re going to continue to do that work in communities to make sure that people are safe, our workers are safe, and most importantly, patients are safe,\" said Dix, who was\\xa0speaking at a press conference announcing a new hospital in Surrey, about 34 km southeast of Vancouver, which is expected to begin construction next summer.With files from Jessica CheungAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

But it\\'s more likely that the child is actually being infected with a number of different viruses, one after the other.\\xa0According to the province\\'s latest flu data, there have been 50 lab-confirmed cases of the flu for the 2021-2022 season.

Typically infections of flu and other viruses spike fall, winter or early spring among children, Jain said.\\xa0\"We\\'re talking anything from the common cold to RSV [respiratory syncytial\\xa0virus , to croup, increased asthma due to viral infections, even some pneumonia,\" he said.\"That was a little unexpected but when you think about it, you know we have increased mixing of the population, dropping of mandates so it just goes to show that those public health measures pre-vaccination were very effective at limiting the spread of respiratory illnesses.\"\\xa0Jain said the emergency room is now starting to see the number of admissions for respiratory illnesses go down.\\xa0Dr. Austin said typically a virus could involve mild symptoms over three to five days, like a low-grade fever, congestion, cough, sore throat and a runny nose. Coughing can sometimes last for up to three weeks in some cases and just as the child is recovering, they pick up another virus.\\xa0\"The times when you\\'d want to seek medical attention would be a persistent fever, certainly a fever beyond five days,\" Austin said.\\xa0\"If they\\'re very lethargic, sleepy, not themselves, not eating and drinking in the usual way.\"She said if a child is in pain or struggling to breath they should also get medical attention.To limit the spread of respiratory illness, Austin said people should make sure they are washing their hands regularly and to stay home if they feel unwell.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Wachter, Chair of UCSF Department of Medicine, stands for a portrait on Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020 in San Francisco, Calif.The new BA.5 strain of the COVID-causing virus is “a different beast” from ones we’ve already seen — more infectious and better able to evade immune responses — and “we need to change our thinking” about how to defend against it, according to a data-packed Twitter thread posted today by Dr. Bob Wachter, UCSF’s chair of medicine.BA.5, a sub-variant of the Omicron family which has an altered version of the virus’s infamous “spike” protein, will soon become the dominant strain of the virus in the U.S., meaning that “its behavior will determine our fate for the next few months, until it either burns itself out by infecting so many people or is replaced by a variant that’s even better at infecting people,” Wachter wrote.“Neither is a joyful scenario,” he added.The number of new COVID cases per day has plateaued nationally and is down significantly since January. The same is true for the number of COVID hospitalizations in the UCSF health system, Watchter said. However, the true spread of COVID is harder to know these days, because so many people are testing themselves with at-home kits.And BA.5 could cause a continued plateau, or even a new surge of infections and possibly hospitalizations, because it infects more easily and also is better at evading immune responses — even in vaccinated people, Wachter wrote.While he stressed that vaccines and vaccine booster shots “remain hugely valuable in preventing a severe case” that might lead to hospitalization or death, the increased slippieriness of BA.5 means that existing vaccines will probably be less effective at preventing mild COVID cases or stopping transmission in the first place. Also, he wrote, prior infection by a different variant “no longer provides robust protection from reinfection” with BA.5.What should a person do, then?COVID-19 Map: Data on trends in the Bay Area and across CaliforniaLatest news: Complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemicWachter said it depends on how badly you want to avoid getting COVID. Personally, he said, he doesn’t want to risk getting “Long COVID” and the debilitating symptoms that come with it, “So I still avoid indoor dining & will continue to wear an N95 in crowded indoor spaces until cases come way down.” Others might make different choices.As for governments, he said, if BA.5 causes a surge in hospitalizations, “particularly if we also have staff shortages,” a return to mask mandates “would be the right call.” But Wachter acknowledged there would likely be fierce resistance to new mask-wearing requirements, especially outside of blue states, regardless of the danger.“Most people have ditched their masks,” he wrote.Jason Fagone (he/him) is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

She said most of the 30 to 40 people at the event appeared to be drinking alcohol.Sgt Heneghan said on the night she was approached by Rose Joyce (53), who said she was staging the event \"for a son who was released from prison earlier that day\".In court, Ms Joyce – who lives at the address – denied saying this and also denied staging an organised event in breach of Covid-19 health regulations when such gatherings were banned.The country was in a Covid lockdown at the time and Judge Alec Gabbett convicted Ms Joyce of staging the event in contravention of Covid-19 regulations and fined her €200.Judge Gabbett said Sgt Heneghan “had been more than fair to Ms Joyce on the night”.The judge said: “When Sgt Heneghan called at 10.37pm the party was at half throttle and Sgt Heneghan had asked Ms Joyce to turn the music down but when she returned at 11.37pm the party was at full throttle”.Judge Gabbett said when Sgt Heneghan called at 11.37pm “the party was still going hard and heavy”.Sgt Heneghan said when she called at 11.37pm, the disco lights were still flashing and the music was still very loud. She said she returned after gardaí received numerous complaints about loud music at the address.She said she directed that the party cease and people were to leave.Sgt Heneghan said she was satisfied that an illegal organised event was taking place in breach of Covid-19 regulations.The Garda Sargeant told the court that Ms Joyce – represented by solicitor, Tara Godfrey – told her that she would have the music turned down but said she wasn’t doing anything wrong as it was all the one family.However, Sgt Heneghan said despite the request that the party cease, the party continued for a number of hours until the early hours.Sgt Heneghan told the court that she issued a Fixed Charge Penalty Notice to Ms Joyce the following day and it remains unpaid resulting in the issuing of the court summons.Want us to email you top stories each lunch time? Toronto/IBNS: A notification reportedly posted to social media by Toronto public health said it will be shortening hours at the city-run immunization clinics during the summer. According to the post, the new hours of operation will begin on Monday and will impact all of the six active clinics offering the COVID-19 vaccine. The new hours are as follows: Both the Metro Hall and Crossroads Plaza clinics will be open between noon to 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. The clinics at Cloverdale Mall, Mitchell Field Community Centre, and 1940 Eglinton Avenue, will be operational from noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. At Thorncliffe Park Community Hub, the clinic will be open between noon to 6 p.m., as well as between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday. All clinics are offering first, second and third doses, as well as fourth doses for select eligible groups. Residents are asked to book an appointment using the provincial booking portal or call centre. Appointments at these clinics for school-based vaccinations such as those for Hepatitis B, HPV, and Meningococcal diseases can also be booked by students in Grades 7 to 12. About 51.7 per cent of all eligible Toronto residents have received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Where the Lekan Salami Stadium is now was a location where we (artists) all ended up in the evenings, coming from all over the town to enjoy ourselves. When you are tired of that place, you can walk down and get to Keru’s hotel. Baba Keru on Ife road. Reverse, and you are at Ekotedo Iya Olobe, there is a bubbling spot there. Reverse again and you would touch West end where Mbari Club from which all of us grew up to know what the depth of cultural involvement is.Go up, you will see the Obisesan Hall, Radio Nigeria, Cocoa Dome and Kingsway Paradise Club. In a corner of Ososami Road, there was a lady who had a nightclub where Rex Williams… no, not Rex Lawson, Rex Williams, another trumpeter, used to play. The Action Group hall was there. Young people were being trained how to play musical instruments, you know, in front of the Odeon Cinema. So, as I sneaked into town today, got here and saw it brimming as usual with people, people and people, after what I can call a somewhat culturally sterile interregnum. I saw that (Tunde) Odunlade is trying to bring back the good old days, doing that which was part of what developed people like me into what we have become…a kind of cultural and artistic renaissance.So, what difference is there in the city in that span of time?Jimi Solanke: The difference is clear: a majority of the people have been deculturised. They have become interested a lot more in western ways. In my culture, when you request medicine to relieve your leg pain, they will recommend a herb which may not be worth more than 50 kobos or at most N400. And when people like us, who go to consult these Babas, give them N5,000 instead of the N400, they go berserk, telling us they need no more than the N400 charged and wondering if we are stupid? You have to be explaining to them to keep the change because you know the medication will cure whatever ailment you may have and the Baba is not going to request from you any other thing after that. But the majority of the regular medicine, capsules… you use now have harmful side effects. Let’s be realistic. I am a Christian but I cannot because of that fact jettison the ways, religion and customs of my ancestors.Does that explain why you still look very much like a 40 -year old at 80?Jimi Solanke: To God be the glory. God is the secret. Again, when people have money, they spoil themselves. They just eat and eat rather carelessly. Once they have money in their pockets, the idea in their mind is ‘let us eat one of those delicious and expensive delicacies, and they will blow about N27, 000 at a go! But the stuff they consume oftentimes may be unhealthy or lack necessary nutrients that can promote their longevity. So, they just pack a lot of dangerous stuff into their systems trying to prove that they have money. That way, the majority of us eat ourselves to death. What’s wrong with eating little or denying ourselves food? That way, we relieve the body of burden. Even our Lord, Jesus Christ, went on 40 days and 40 nights fasting.You mean you fast?Jimi Solanke: I do a lot of fasting.How does it help?Jimi Solanke: This body we carry around is a machine. If you love to eat too much and feed it indiscriminately because you have money, the machine soon gets overworked and might just give up. Man does not come to this life because of ponmo and Amala, not just for bread. Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m choosy about what goes into my stomach. My diet essentially consists of green vegetables, ewedu especially. I drink ewedu like water and I do not eat any meat but fish. I hate maalu (beef). I don’t eat it at all. Even my wife, who loves ponmo, once in a while puts it on my plate. But when I finish eating, she will still come and pick the ponmo from my plate. I eat fruits, nuts, palm, and epa (groundnuts). Since days back, if two handfuls of epa get inside of me, I will live for the next two days. I never feel hungry. It’s all in the mind. The state of mind is also very important. I live a contented life. Would you believe I buy epa just to soak garri and a piece of sugar to have a meal, and I will be so contented and will sleep fine? I told my wife I didn’t want to be a landlord in my life. Now it happens that we are leaving a whole house in Ife and coming home to Ipara to build a cultural centre and to also live there.How so?Jimi Solanke: Because I believe I have something that I should do that I’ve not done.And what could that be?Jimi Solanke: I can’t even pinpoint it. It’s something between me and my God and I will do it before I leave this earth. I guess that’s why I’m still alive.Chief Ebenezer Obey and yourself are contemporaries among the pioneers of modern African music, alongside Tunji Oyelana, King Sunny Ade Haruna Ishola and Sikiru Ayinde. What do you make of the fortunes of your various genres – Apala, Fuji, Juju and folk music in contemporary musical context?Jimi Solanke: A pity majority of our children don’t have the eyes or ears to appreciate our culture. They don’t have the patience to learn anything about African traditions. All they do now is give themselves, free of charge, to foreign climes and peoples culturally different from us – US, UK and all of that. I am pained. When, as a Yoruba man, you crave or romance an alien culture for relevance, you are no more than an empty bag, cultureless, with no origin and so you end up pained and you will suffer. That’s because they have nothing original to offer or that can compete with what you have in terms of creativity and uniqueness. What do they want to do there that will be better than yours? Talking of competitiveness, the Yoruba culture is number one in the whole of Africa. It will be good for you to propagate this Yoruba cultural heritage because, in Brazil, people are studying Yoruba, in America, about 56 or 64 universities are teaching Yoruba, in Cuba, all over the world.Aren’t you afraid for the future of indigenous music and civilization with the younger generation’s apparent disinterest in them and preference for pop culture?Jimi Solanke: The Hausa do say: “Serkin Goma, Zamani Goma,” which in Yoruba translates: “Oba mewa, igba mewa”. That’s the way I see the matter. I’ve lived up to nearly eighty, I’ve seen different kinds of music evolve and last for so long and at the end of the day, they fade away or die. These hip-hop musicians you speak of, I clap for them. Whatever lyrics they put into their songs, it’s their time now. I’ve seen it before they too will evolve and realism will dawn that everything follows a pattern. That is: rise and fall.What’s the update on your novel project at Ipara? Are we having an academy or theatre village there Like Baba Hubert Ogunde’s Film Village in Ososa?Jimi Solanke: Yes, Ibudo Asa, Ipara, is a centre for creative and performing arts enhancement. Enhancement in the sense that if you’re a graduate and you are still looking for how to step in and stamp your feet on the ground of performances, come, you will get your skills enhanced. We will through a practical approach take you through the rudiments of stage presence, voice mastery, acting and total theatre experience for continuity of live stage performance. Live theatre because live theatre is all I was trained for as a young man who went into thespianism. Maybe that’s why I’m a bit more of a dramatic person even when I sing. I act everything I sing and all that. Live theatre is what I believe in most. We are not building a big academy as such, but we will be having a lot of people coming for workshops on different areas of thespian life. Everything is involved including music because music is part of theatre.So, what stage is the project now?Jimi Solanke: Well, we have put up a structure in place with rooms each having its own toilet, the ceiling’s done and the whole place wired by an electrician, Now, I have a very spacious living room about two times the size of this (Tunde Odunlade Arts Connexions Gallery’s lounge where the interview was conducted). My hall contains at least 50-60 people. We have hosted a lot of artists and visitors already. We have done book readings, and that is still testing, testing the microphone (laughs). It is the outside hall, the stage, and the sitting area that we are facing now.Which exactly is your forte or favourite mode of artistic expression – music, acting or storytelling?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me, sir, when you are a thespian, it means you are an actor, a singer, a dancer, you are everything that equals performance. When I stand before an audience and tell stories, I’m acting. Perhaps, that’s why a lot of people love me telling stories, because I act, innovate and mimic the sound of a chicken, that of a lion, and also give the tortoise a voice. It’s all part of thespianism, it’s all part of acting, it’s all part of playing a role.But there must be one that makes your heart beat in a special way.Jimi Solanke: I tell you, there’s no favourite, no distinction up till now. Music, acting, everything are all under the same umbrella. As far as I am concerned, maybe that’s the reason why God has been keeping me, to live my destiny. I sing for the sake of thespianism and not for money or anybody. It’s like fulfilling a calling or being inspired primarily to delight and add value to humanity, you know, like: “Eleyi o ko sita (Lo, sing this for the world), not like the “Onitemi o, Abiola ti de, o de towotowo, owo lo n na” lyrics of the crowd of commercial musicians. In all the plays I’ve acted in, nobody can fault any movement or any tonal quality of my delivery as an actor. My good Lord has decreed it that this man is an actor. He chose me because He was looking for who would act well. You know, honest acting, true acting, acting for the sake of acting, it’s a spiritual thing, I believe. Acting is not to show off, acting is going there to build a role from the sole of your feet to the tip of the hair on your head to everything on your fingernails.How about your favourite song?Jimi Solanke: All my songs are very much my favourites. You cannot openly say in front of all your children that this one is your favourite. As I was performing out there tonight and, as you know, my band is not even complete here. Thank God I brought one person along. We couldn’t get to play ‘Osupa’, not even ‘Ojoje’, simply because we didn’t have sequence rehearsed band to accompany it. I’ve been having hits since the days of ‘Eje ka jo’ in the 60s, you have ‘Onile Gogoro’, even right now, I am in the studio.Oh yeah, so what should we expect?Jimi Solanke: Ten tracks, ten tracks of fresh, delightful music and I am not playing exclusively with the old approach, but with a blend of the younger generation’s style. (plays back a recording of three tracks from the demo album). What do you think of it?Beautiful, nice.Jimi Solanke: We are trying to subtly infuse into their (young ones) entertainment our tradition. While we let them dance the way they know how to do it, we send in the message so it can sink when they hear it and say: “Ah, is that not that Baba?” We want to start from there to reach every depth and fibre of their being. I’m even going back into animating all the old stories with this same voice that their parents used to hear back in the years. We must try our best artistically, and intensively to make sure that we do not lose these children to alien cultures.How have you been coping with the Covid-19 pandemic, general insecurity and cash crunch being experienced in the country?Jimi Solanke: I decided to start my centre just before 2000 and things were fine then, we had jobs here, engagements there, bookings all over, and so, we started the foundation, construction and all that. We moved to the lintel stage and needed four blocks more to give us room space. We had not even done the ceiling, but we had bought a lot of things that we needed to build because then, we were buoyant. We still had money. It was exciting and I was just spending all my savings, went to POS to collect money to buy building materials. But that was where the Covid lockdown met me. By the time we came out of lockdown, we just had to manage to try and finish up some sections including painting the exterior and completing the rest of the structure.So, in a way, the Covid thing helped, because I would have used the money for other purposes. But when lockdown came, I started feeling it that, ah, this is a ‘be careful case oh’ (laughs), because we were just spending the money we had saved. So, I locked up the place and went back to Ife with my wife, because I spent all the money I made from everywhere and the income was no longer flowing in as before. So, yes, it affected all of us because there were no more bookings, no programme, nothing because they said no crowd must gather, nobody must move one arm’s length. Till now, it has not been easy even with the majority of big bands. But, as I told people “Lala to lo s’oke, o n bo ni le ni.” Lala is a shout like a rising yeeeeeeee cry. The noise will definitely and ultimately subside and get to a point where people will begin to mutter Uhn, uhn, Ahn Ahn. So that’s all about this Covid. For me, however, everything that happens in my life and surrounding, I believe was meant to be. We must still be grateful to God for everything because some are not so lucky to still be alive, some of my colleagues died…Killed by the disease…?Jimi Solanke: No, …because they could not maintain their lifestyle. Now with the insecurity in the land, one expects that our rulers from the bottom to the very top of the hierarchy should be able to put it down decisively. How can Abuja to Kaduna be unmotorable, with such money put into governors’ pockets as security funds every month, every year? And to think that the military is enjoying the best of times now. What with a lot of money they are being given, unless they want to deny that the humongous money claimed to have been given to them was false.Let’s be realistic, we are playing games with one another and they have to stop it. Some people in this country are frivolously toying with the fate of millions of Nigerians. My grandchildren, beautiful, intelligent young persons who I love so much, must not suffer from their stupidity. They have killed all that we take for granted, which gives us joy and happiness. They had done that with themselves a long time ago, they have spread it into the whole nation, killing all the universities, killing all educational facilities, knocking everything out, all of us are just going to remain an Almajiri now, which is terrible. That’s why we have to stop them. We have to stop all this. If they have no interest in getting things to be better than amassing more money to the ones they have stolen, they should not disturb and destroy us. Look at the ministers, look at all the appointments, look at everything and you will see that they have won. They are chopping Nigeria’s money. Let them be contented with that and let us be. We have resources minus oil money, minus other money, to turn our lives around positively in our part of the country. We’re tired of all this rubbish,Much more than our own broadcast media and networks, the BBC seems to be doing more for African cultures and languages with its pervasive indigenous content and programming – now we have BBC Yoruba, BBC Hausa, BBC pidgin all exhaustively covering and beaming news and other interesting aspects of the life of Nigeria and its people to millions across not just the country, but the continent, especially via its social media platforms. Apart from the possibility of BBC’s popularity rating and advert income overtaking these local stations, is the peculiar development healthy for our cultural and national development? Also, is the foreign broadcasting giant’s success not an indictment of African broadcasters’ lack of patriotism and initiative to reverse the much-criticized lopsided global information order? What exactly is their handicap? Three-in-one question there for you.Jimi Solanke: When you have a media group paid by the government not doing what is right and others not owned by the government being the ones doing that you would put money on, there’s nothing more honourable than for you to just lock up your studio. That is the kind of situation we have in Nigeria. When otherwise upright media want to speak or do what is right and look right and left and see that if they should do so, they might have ‘Dongaris’ at their offices’ doorsteps the next day or having them shut, they will not. Instead, they too will join the follow, follow the band. Look at NTA? What can they do? You see, we have been warned. We have been tortured in this space called Nigeria not to know or talk about our culture. That is why the government or the rulers chopped off the teaching of history out of our school curriculum. I’m not afraid of anybody. I am eighty years old. I have grandchildren and the truth is better told. You can’t afford to keep playing with the lives of people.Don’t you think media promoters and operators themselves have a share in the blame?Jimi Solanke: Excuse me with this your mindset and attitude of vision and mission. Do you want to know why they didn’t and couldn’t do it? You go and set up a station where you want to do it and see what will happen.DonateTEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999\\nxProduct()if (screen && screen.width > 1024){var script=document.createElement(\\'script\\'); script.src=\\'//served-by.pixfuture.com/www/delivery/headerbid.js\\'; script.setAttribute(\"slotId\",\"20018x300x600x3423x_ADSLOT9\"); script.setAttribute(\"refreshInterval\",30); script.setAttribute(\"refreshTime\",5); document.getElementById(\"20018x300x600x3423x_ADSLOT9\").appendChild(script);}Enter your email address and receive notifications of news by email.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoin 1,905,368 other subscribers.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail Address                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t                        Subscribe                        \\n\\nvar adx_adsvr_adspace_vAppRoot=\"https://ads.dochase.com/adx-dir-d/\";\\nvar adx_adsvr_adspace_id=\"3985\";\\nvar adx_size=\"300x250\";\\nvar adx_custom=\"\";\\nvar adx_nid=\"13\";\\n\\n\\n\\nvar adx_adsvr_adspace_vAppRoot=\"https://ads.dochase.com/adx-dir-d/\";\\nvar adx_adsvr_adspace_id=\"3985\";\\nvar adx_size=\"300x250\";\\nvar adx_custom=\"\";\\nvar adx_nid=\"13\";\\n\\n All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, Nigeria All content is Copyrighted © 2020 The Premium Times, NigeriaThis article briefly summarizes several relatively important solutions that can greatly facilitate COVID-19 research.\\xa0COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Development SupportThe global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 caused a large amount of investment and research attention to developing\\xa0preventive vaccines. Among the massive achievements made by using published genomes, mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 stand out because of their\\xa0better performance in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Currently, mRNA vaccine is publicly deemed as a very useful strategy in anti-SARS-CoV-2 campaigns, thereby demanding reliable technology support to drive the pressing needs in research and commercial manufacturing.\\xa0Many biotech corporations like BOC Sciences have become significant contributors to\\xa0the campaign by providing advanced mRNA technologies ranging from\\xa0mRNA design &\\xa0synthesis,\\xa0in vivo\\xa0delivery solutions, to mRNA\\xa0vaccine production.\\xa0\\xa0As the crux of successful mRNA vaccine production, the nucleic acid sequences\\xa0should be synthesized with a variety of modifications so that they can be applied\\xa0to different antigens. Vaccine researchers or manufacturers who call for mRNA synthesis services usually provide the DNA templates for their partners who are able to generate mRNAs later. Occasionally, mRNA is also synthesized from scratch if no templates are available.\\xa0Liposome Drug Delivery\\xa0SupportResearch about COVID-19 drugs is also proceeding in full swing. With the aid of liposome-based drug delivery systems, the faster and safer delivery of drugs becomes possible which tremendously speeds up the process of COVID-19 drugs from trials to market.\\xa0Liposome-based mRNA delivery\\xa0solutions span\\xa0from custom liposome production, characterization to application. The\\xa0encapsulation of mRNA into liposomes can ensure the safety and effectiveness of delivery. It has been demonstrated that cationic liposome formulations greatly promote the functional delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids to cells.\\xa0Oligo Synthesis Services For COVID-19 ResearchResearchers may have\\xa0custom oligo synthesis\\xa0requirements\\xa0for their COVID-19 research. Some may need RNA molecules with multiple chemical modifications, while others demand\\xa0custom synthesis\\xa0and labeling of\\xa0RNA oligonucleotides.\\xa0The renowned Dim-Dmoc technology is now usually applied for custom-made synthetic RNA. There is also a broad portfolio of fluorescent dye modifications and chemical modifications for the fluorescent labeling of siRNA and RNA control oligonucleotides.\\xa0On the one hand, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 research, siRNA synthesis is used to study human gene function involving cell entry and host-pathogen interaction or designed to silence viral genes to ensure that off-target suppression of human genes is minimized. On the other hand, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, RNA control techniques help confirm whether researchers\\' diagnostic test is effective when they amplify the region of interest RNA or DNA, monitor the performance of PCR master mix, and\\xa0verify that the virus detection primers are valid.\\xa0ConclusionMany biotech companies have focused on the mRNA vaccine, drug, and therapy development programs during the pandemic. With their consistent contribution, more advanced and effective solutions to mitigate the plague are\\xa0to be explored in the near future.\\n\\nPharmiWeb.com is Europe\\'s leading industry-sponsored portal for the Pharmaceutical sector, providing the latest jobs, news, features and events listings.The information provided on PharmiWeb.com is designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between a patient/site visitor and his/her physician.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\n\\r\\n            follow us\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\r\\n            Copyright © 2022 PHARMIWEB.COM LIMITED, rights reserved by the relevant holders.\\r\\n        \\n\\r\\n        Version: 2022.3.2.1\\r\\n    You are leaving PharmiWeb.comDisclaimer: You are now leaving PharmiWeb.com website and are going to a website that is not operated by us.

A Danish study disclosed that the virus which has killed many across the globe can increase the risk of developing life-altering brain challenges.The researchers of the study analysed the data collected from 919,731 people who tested for the virus. Out of those, 43,375 positive patients were 3.5 times likelier to develop Alzheimer\\'s and 2.6 times more likely to get Parkinson’s later in life.Even worse, the group was 4.8 times more like to go through a brain bleed.\\xa0“We found support for an increased risk of being diagnosed with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19 positive compared to COVID-negative patients, which must be confirmed or refuted by large registry studies in the near future,\" said\\xa0Dr Pardis Zarifkar, lead author from the Department of Neurology at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Acording to Eureka Alert, the study was presented at the 8th European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress.Sign InSign InThe Star EditionCHANGE LOCATION This copy is for your personal non-commercial use only.

Then there’s the fact, he says, that about 40 per cent of public health units now have a reproduction number greater than one — all amounting to evidence the province has entered another wave.“Putting all of this together, I think we’re seeing the beginning of a wave,” Razak said. “But it does not look like it has the intensity in terms of amplitude or pace of what we saw with the start of the Omicron wave. How fast it will rise and what the peak will be are unclear. “Based on everything that we’re seeing, both in Ontario and globally, this is likely to be a less severe wave than what we’ve experienced in the past with less direct pressure on the health-care system.”Razak’s red flag comes as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended this week that additional boosters be given to a larger portion of the population in the fall. Other regions are also seeing a rise in hospitalizations driven by Omicron subvariants, including Quebec, which recently experienced a surge in community transmission and cases in health-care workers. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports that infections are growing in 110 countries driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, resulting in an overall 20 per cent increase in global cases. Several infectious disease experts say fourth doses should be offered to all residents now ahead of a possible fall wave, while others say only those who are deemed at higher risk should be getting a second booster.“If you’re someone who is higher-risk or is in a situation where you’re being exposed to a lot because you’re on TTC twice a day, in and out of work or something like that, it would be very reasonable to go and get that fourth shot now,” Razak said. “On the other hand, if you are otherwise low-risk and you have very little day-to-day exposure, it is reasonable to wait to get that booster dose until you’re closer to the fall or there’s more concretely a rise happening.”At a press conference Thursday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said up-to-date vaccinations are the “foundation of our protection” and that those who had two doses and a booster shot had hospitalization rates that were five times lower than unvaccinated people during the Omicron wave in April and May.She also reiterated NACI’s recommendations that those at risk of severe illness receive a fourth shot now, as boosters “increase protection by activating your immune response to restore protection that may have decreased over time.”Dr. Gerald Evans, the chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen’s University, said it’s uncertain whether fourth doses will be effective enough against BA.4 and BA.5 for the larger population. Those subvariants have an alteration within their genomes, making it more difficult for antibodies to bind to the spike proteins, which in turn makes these variants more likely to have immune-evading properties, he explained.Pfizer and Moderna are developing vaccines that will specifically target Omicron, known as bivalent vaccines, which will likely be available in the fall. Both companies say they’ve tested their vaccines and they appear to be highly effective against Omicron, and plan to submit their data to governments in the next few months. “I do totally agree that we should be rolling out boosters in the fall,” said Evans. He predicts a wave will occur in the late fall or early winter, and another will follow in the late winter or early spring because that’s how the COVID-19 virus has behaved previously, similar to other illnesses in the coronavirus category, he said. NACI also announced in a release Wednesday that everyone aged 12 to 65 may be offered another dose in the fall, regardless of the number of previous doses, but that recommendation is “discretionary” and not categorized as a strong recommendation. Those groups include all residents over 65; people 12 and older who have underlying medical conditions; Indigenous adults; racialized and marginalized communities that have been harder hit by the virus throughout the pandemic; migrant workers; residents of shelters, correctional facilities and group homes.Recommendations will be provided on the type of COVID-19 booster dose that should be offered as evidence emerges on bivalent vaccines.NACI said in its press release that “cases of COVID-19, including associated hospitalizations and deaths, are currently declining in Canada. However, the likelihood, timing, and severity of a future wave of COVID-19 is uncertain.”Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said he is afraid the increasing signals Ontario is experiencing could mean we are approaching endemicity.“My belief is that when we took masks off on the TTC, we started to harmonize different wastewater signals across the GTA. In other words, mixing people together on the TTC is not going to cause the signal at one wastewater treatment plant to go down, it’s going to cause the other ones to come up to match,” he said.“If you think about that logically, that kind of synchronization, that’s a path to endemicity. Not a wave that comes and then subsides, but a new normal where the line is flat but it is at a very elevated level.”He added that the elevations in wastewater signals, as well as cases in public health units, reflect the dropping of mask mandates earlier this month.“But it’s not just that. It’s the mindset that goes with it. We see more and more people who ought to know better engaging in crazy, risky behaviour,” Furness said. “If I can be on the TTC and I don’t need to have a mask, then I can go out to dinner because that’s obviously less dangerous and if that’s the case, I can definitely go see a movie. “It’s causing self-destructive logic to take hold.”Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

Just 10% believe the pandemic has already ended.Over four in five people, or 82%, believe vaccines, in general, are effective while 76% of people trust the medical evidence about vaccines. Over half of people could spontaneously name four vaccine-preventable diseases, with Covid-19, measles, mumps and rubella cited most often.Just under half of people, or 48%, have not received adult vaccinations for diseases other than Covid-19. These diseases could include flu, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis B, whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.The survey finds that 91% of people have been vaccinated for Covid-19, with three in four people having received at least one booster vaccine dose for the disease. One in four people, or 25%, say they are more likely to get vaccinated for other diseases as a result of getting protected against Covid-19.\\nWorld\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-9703-1708Hala Abou El Naja,http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4395-347XStefano Tempia,Amal Barakat,Amgad Elkholy,Amir Aman,Wasiq Khan,Abdinasir AbubakarCorrespondence to Dr Abdinasir Abubakar; abubakara@who.intIntroduction A global reduction in influenza virus activity during the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed, including in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). However, these changes have not been thoroughly evaluated scientifically in the EMR.Objective We aim to present data on seasonal influenza activity during the pre-pandemic period (2016–2019) and compare it to the pandemic period (2020–2021) in EM countries.Methods Epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data were retrieved from both WHO FluNet and EMFLU networks. Four pre-pandemic analytical periods were used in the comparative analysis. We compiled and calculated weekly aggregated epidemiological data on the number of enrolled patients, number of tested specimens and number of positive influenza specimens.Results 19 out of the 22 countries of the EMR have functioning sentinel influenza surveillance systems, and these countries report the influenza data to WHO through FluNet and EMFLU. The number of enrolled patients and tested specimens increased gradually from 51\\u2009384 and 50 672, respectively, in 2016–2017 analytical period to 194\\u2009049 enrolled patients and 124\\u2009697 tested specimens in 2019–2020. A decrease has been witnessed in both enrolled patients and tested specimens in 2020–2021 ‘pandemic period’ (166\\u2009576 and 44\\u2009764, respectively). By comparing influenza activity of analytical period 2020–2021 with that of 2016–2019 analytical periods, we found that there has been a decrease in influenza positivity rate in the EMR by 89%.Conclusion The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic may have also impacted the spread of influenza viruses. The low circulation of influenza viruses during 2020–2021 and the associated potential immunity gap may result in increased transmission and severity of post-pandemic influenza seasons. This necessitates high vigilance to continuous data and virus sharing to monitor circulating viruses in a timely fashion to reduce the intensity and severity of future influenza epidemics.Read the full report\\nWorld\\n+ 2 more\\n\\nWorld\\n\\nWorld\\n\\nWorld\\n\\n\\nReliefWeb\\'s Terms & Conditions.\\n\\n© 2022 all rights reserved.Related PlatformsOther OCHA Services\\xa0'"
